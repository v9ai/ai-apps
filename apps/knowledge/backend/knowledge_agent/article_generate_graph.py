Topic: {topic}
Slug: {slug}
Category: {category}

Research notes:
{research}

Existing articles in this knowledge base for cross-referencing:
{existing_articles}

Create a detailed outline for this article. The article must follow a "simple-first, then deep" arc:

1. `# Title` — concise, descriptive
2. **Opening paragraph** (no heading): one paragraph that explains what this is, why it matters, and sets context. Avoid jargon here.
3. `## Mental Model` — **plain-English first**. Build intuition before any code. Three short subsections:
   - `### What problem does it solve?` — contrast with the naive/linear approach
   - `### The whiteboard analogy` — a concrete visual analogy (~120 words) ending with a `xyflow` JSON diagram
   - `### Hello-world in ~10 lines` — minimum viable example with a matching `xyflow` JSON diagram
4. `## Core Concepts` — definitions, type signatures, foundational primitives. Each major primitive gets a `xyflow` diagram alongside the code.
5. `## How It Works` — technical sections with Python code examples and `xyflow` diagrams illustrating control flow / state changes.
6. `## Runtime Internals` — **deep-dive** section: explain the underlying execution model (e.g., for LangGraph: Pregel/BSP supersteps, channels, deterministic replay). This is "why it works the way it does," not just "what the API is."
7. `## Patterns` — practical production patterns with at least one `xyflow` diagram per pattern (e.g., fan-out, supervisor, HITL).
8. `## Common Pitfalls` — what goes wrong and how to detect it.
9. `## Comparison` with alternatives (if applicable).

For each section, note:
- Key points to cover
- Code examples needed — match the topic's natural language: SQL for database topics, Python for LLM/agent topics (LangGraph, agents), TypeScript where the API is JS-only. For LangGraph articles specifically, all examples must be Python.
- **Diagrams**: every conceptual section must specify at least one `xyflow` JSON diagram — total target ≥ 6 diagrams across the article. Do NOT use mermaid; use the xyflow JSON fence described in the draft prompt.
- Cross-references to related articles using markdown links like [Article Title](/slug)

Output the outline as markdown with section headers and bullet points under each.
"""

DRAFT_PROMPT = """You are an expert AI engineer and technical writer. Write a comprehensive knowledge base article.

Topic: {topic}
Slug: {slug}

Outline:
{outline}

Research notes:
{research}

Style reference (match this tone, depth, and format):
---
{style_sample}
---

Structural requirements:
- Start with `# Title` — a clear, descriptive title
- Opening paragraph: explain what this is, why it matters, cross-reference related articles
- **Second section MUST be `## Mental Model`** with the three subsections from the outline (problem, analogy, hello-world). Build intuition before any deep API material.
- Use `##` for major sections, `###` for subsections
- Include a `## Runtime Internals` deep-dive section that explains the execution model, not just the API surface
- Cross-reference at least 2 related articles as [Title](/slug) links

Code requirements:
- Include at least 3 real, working code examples in the language natural to the topic: **SQL** for database articles (PostgreSQL, MySQL, query optimization), **Python** for LLM/agent articles (LangGraph, agents, ML), **TypeScript** where the API is JS-only. Do not force Python into a SQL article or vice versa.
- Use ```python or ```typescript code fences with proper syntax
- Include tables for comparisons using markdown pipe syntax

Diagram requirements (CRITICAL — use xyflow, NOT mermaid):
- Include **at least 5 interactive graph diagrams** using the ```xyflow code fence with strict JSON inside
- Each xyflow block is rendered as a draggable React Flow graph by the knowledge app — DO NOT write mermaid syntax, DO NOT use ```mermaid fences
- The JSON schema is exactly:

  ```xyflow
  {{
    "direction": "TD",
    "nodes": [
      {{"id": "user", "label": "User Query", "shape": "circle"}},
      {{"id": "agent", "label": "Agent\\nNode", "shape": "rect"}},
      {{"id": "decide", "label": "Has tool calls?", "shape": "diamond"}},
      {{"id": "tool", "label": "ToolNode", "shape": "rect"}},
      {{"id": "done", "label": "Response", "shape": "circle"}}
    ],
    "edges": [
      {{"source": "user", "target": "agent"}},
      {{"source": "agent", "target": "decide"}},
      {{"source": "decide", "target": "tool", "label": "yes"}},
      {{"source": "decide", "target": "done", "label": "no"}},
      {{"source": "tool", "target": "agent"}}
    ]
  }}
  ```

- `direction` must be `"TD"` (top-down) or `"LR"` (left-right). TD for hierarchical flows, LR for pipelines.
- `shape` must be one of: `"rect"` (default), `"circle"` (start/end states), `"diamond"` (decisions), `"stadium"` (events).
- Edges MUST reference existing node ids in the same block.
- Use `\\n` inside labels for line breaks.
- Optional `"label"` on edges for branch conditions.
- Output **valid JSON only** inside the xyflow fence — no comments, no trailing commas. The renderer uses JSON.parse().

Diagram placement:
- One xyflow block in the whiteboard analogy subsection
- One xyflow block matching the hello-world code
- One xyflow block per major Core Concept primitive that has control flow (e.g., conditional routing, fan-out)
- One xyflow block in Runtime Internals showing the execution loop / superstep model
- One xyflow block per pattern in `## Patterns`

Audience & length:
- Write for an intermediate-to-senior AI engineer audience, but the Mental Model section should be approachable to a beginner
- Be specific and technical in the deep sections — no hand-waving or filler
- Target 2500–4500 words
- No frontmatter, no YAML headers — just pure markdown starting with `# Title`

Write the complete article now.

Review this article and produce an improved final version. Check for:
1. Technical accuracy — are claims correct? Are code examples valid?
2. Completeness — are important aspects of the topic missing?
3. Code quality — do examples use best practices? Are they runnable?
4. Structure — does the flow make sense? Are sections well-organized?
5. Cross-references — are links to related articles using correct /slug format?
6. Conciseness — remove filler, tighten prose, keep it dense with information
7. Tables and comparisons — are they clear and accurate?
