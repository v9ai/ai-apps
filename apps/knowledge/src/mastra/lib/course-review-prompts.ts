- Real-world exercises: do assignments reflect problems learners will face outside the course?
- Portfolio-worthy output: will completing the course leave the learner with something demonstrable?
- Theory-to-practice ratio: is there enough doing, not just watching or reading?
- Skill transfer: do exercises build transferable skills or just reproduce the instructor's steps?

Evaluate this single dimension only: fit within a 90-lesson AI engineering curriculum.

The curriculum covers these domains: transformers & attention, RAG pipelines, agentic systems,
fine-tuning & PEFT, evaluation & evals frameworks, inference infrastructure, AI safety & alignment,
and multimodal models. The curriculum targets working engineers building production AI systems.

Assess:
- Domain alignment: does this course address one or more curriculum domains substantively?
- Complementarity: does it fill a genuine gap, or duplicate what the 90-lesson core already covers?
- Level fit: is the depth appropriate for an engineering audience (not too introductory, not too niche)?
- Practical overlap: would a learner who completed the core curriculum find this additive?

- Accessibility for beginners: if the course targets beginners, does it avoid assuming unstated background?
- Prerequisite check: does the course provide any self-assessment or orientation to confirm readiness?

  YouTube (Andrej Karpathy, Yannic Kilcher, etc.), or official documentation?
- Pricing justification: is the price point consistent with the content volume and quality?
- Certificate value: does a completion certificate from this platform carry weight with employers?
- Unique advantage: does the course have a distinctive angle — proprietary datasets, exclusive projects,
  notable instructor, production-grade codebase — that free sources cannot replicate?
