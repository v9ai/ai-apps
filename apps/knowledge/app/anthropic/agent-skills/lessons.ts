A skill is a markdown file that teaches Claude how to do something once. Claude then applies that knowledge automatically whenever it's relevant.

## What Skills Are

Skills are folders of instructions and resources that Claude Code can discover and use to handle tasks more accurately. Each skill lives in a SKILL.md file with a name and description in its frontmatter.

The description is how Claude decides whether to use the skill. When you ask Claude to review a PR, it matches your request against available skill descriptions and finds the relevant one. Claude reads your request, compares it to all available skill descriptions, and activates the ones that match.

Here's what a skill's frontmatter looks like:

\`\`\`markdown
---
name: pr-review
description: Reviews pull requests for code quality. Use when reviewing PRs or checking code changes.
---
\`\`\`

Below the frontmatter, you write the actual instructions — your review checklist, formatting preferences, or whatever Claude needs to know for that task.

## Where Skills Live

You can store skills in different places depending on who needs them:

- **Personal skills** go in \`~/.claude/skills\` (your home directory). These follow you across all your projects — your commit message style, your documentation format, how you like code explained.
- **Project skills** go in \`.claude/skills\` inside the root directory of your repository. Anyone who clones the repo gets these skills automatically. This is where team standards live, like your company's brand guidelines, preferred fonts, and colors for web design.

On Windows, personal skills live in \`C:/Users/<your-user>/.claude/skills\`.

Project skills get committed to version control alongside your code, so the whole team shares them.

## Skills vs. CLAUDE.md vs. Slash Commands

Claude Code has several ways to customize behavior. Skills are unique because they're automatic and task-specific. Here's how they compare:

- **CLAUDE.md files** load into every conversation. If you want Claude to always use TypeScript's strict mode, that goes in CLAUDE.md.
- **Skills** load on demand when they match your request. Claude only loads the name and description initially, so they don't fill up your entire context window. Your PR review checklist doesn't need to be in context when you're debugging — it loads when you actually ask for a review.
- **Slash commands** require you to explicitly type them. Skills don't. Claude applies them when it recognizes the situation.

When Claude matches a skill to your request, you'll see it load in the terminal.

## When to Use Skills

Skills work best for specialized knowledge that applies to specific tasks:

- Code review standards your team follows
- Commit message formats you prefer
- Brand guidelines for your organization
- Documentation templates for specific types of docs
- Debugging checklists for particular frameworks

The rule of thumb is simple: if you find yourself explaining the same thing to Claude repeatedly, that's a skill waiting to be written.`,

    ],
    body: `Let's walk through creating a skill from scratch, then look at how Claude Code actually loads and matches skills behind the scenes.

## Creating a Skill

We'll build a personal skill that teaches Claude how to write PR descriptions in a consistent format. Since it's a personal skill, it lives in your home directory and works across all your projects.

First, create a directory for your skill inside the skills folder. The directory name should match your skill name:

\`\`\`bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/pr-description
\`\`\`

Then create a SKILL.md file inside that directory. The file has two parts separated by frontmatter dashes:

\`\`\`markdown
---
name: pr-description
description: Writes pull request descriptions. Use when creating a PR, writing a PR, or when the user asks to summarize changes for a pull request.
---

When writing a PR description:

1. Run \`git diff main...HEAD\` to see all changes on this branch
2. Write a description following this format:

## What
One sentence explaining what this PR does.

## Why
Brief context on why this change is needed

## Changes
- Bullet points of specific changes made
- Group related changes together
- Mention any files deleted or renamed
\`\`\`

The name identifies your skill. The description tells Claude when to use it — this is the matching criteria. Everything after the second set of dashes is the instructions Claude follows when the skill is activated.

## Testing Your Skill

Claude Code loads skills at startup, so restart your session after creating one. You can verify it's available by checking the available skills list.

You should see your skill listed. To test it, make some changes on a branch and say something like "write a PR description for my changes." Claude will indicate it's using the PR description skill, check your diff, and write a description following your template — same format every time.

## How Skill Matching Works

When Claude Code starts, it scans four locations for skills but only loads the name and description — not the full content. This is an important detail.

When you send a request, Claude compares your message against the descriptions of all available skills. For example, "explain what this function does" would match a skill described as "explain code with visual diagrams" because the intent overlaps.

Once a match is found, Claude asks you to confirm loading the skill. This confirmation step keeps you aware of what context Claude is pulling in. After you confirm, Claude reads the complete SKILL.md file and follows its instructions.

## Skill Priority

If you clone a repository that has a skill with the same name as one of your personal skills, which one wins? There's a clear priority order:

1. **Enterprise** — managed settings, highest priority
2. **Personal** — your home directory (\`~/.claude/skills\`)
3. **Project** — the \`.claude/skills\` directory inside a repository
4. **Plugins** — installed plugins, lowest priority

This lets organizations enforce standards through enterprise skills while still allowing individual customization. If your company has an enterprise "code-review" skill and you create a personal "code-review" skill with the same name, the enterprise version takes precedence.

To avoid conflicts, use descriptive names. Instead of just "review," use something like "frontend-review" or "backend-review."

## Updating and Removing Skills

To update a skill, edit its SKILL.md file. To remove one, delete its directory. Restart Claude Code after any changes for them to take effect.`,
    reflection: [
      "What's one task in your daily workflow that you could turn into a skill right now? What would the description look like?",

    ],
    body: `A basic skill works with just a name and description, but there are several advanced techniques that can make your skills much more effective in Claude Code. Let's walk through the key fields, best practices for descriptions, tool restrictions, and how to structure larger skills.

## Skill Metadata Fields

The agent skills open standard supports several fields in the SKILL.md frontmatter. Two are required, and the rest are optional:

- **name** (required) — Identifies your skill. Use lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only. Maximum 64 characters. Should match your directory name.
- **description** (required) — Tells Claude when to use the skill. Maximum 1,024 characters. This is the most important field because Claude uses it for matching.
- **allowed-tools** (optional) — Restricts which tools Claude can use when the skill is active.
- **model** (optional) — Specifies which Claude model to use for the skill.

## Writing Effective Descriptions

Be explicit with your instructions. If someone told you "your job is to help with docs," you wouldn't know what to do — and Claude thinks the same way.

A good description answers two questions:

1. What does the skill do?
2. When should Claude use it?

If your skill isn't triggering when you expect it to, try adding more keywords that match how you actually phrase your requests. The description is what Claude uses to decide whether a skill is relevant, so the language matters.

## Restricting Tools with allowed-tools

Sometimes you want a skill that can only read files, not modify them. This is useful for security-sensitive workflows, read-only tasks, or any situation where you want guardrails.

In this example, the \`allowed-tools\` field is set to \`Read, Grep, Glob, Bash\`. When this skill is active, Claude can only use those tools without asking permission — no editing, no writing.

\`\`\`markdown
---
name: codebase-onboarding
description: Helps new developers understand the system works.
allowed-tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash
model: sonnet
---
\`\`\`

If you omit \`allowed-tools\` entirely, the skill doesn't restrict anything. Claude uses its normal permission model.

## Progressive Disclosure

Skills share Claude's context window with your conversation. When Claude activates a skill, it loads the contents of that SKILL.md into context. But sometimes you need references, examples, or utility scripts that the skill depends on.

Cramming everything into one 2,000-line file has two problems: it takes up a lot of context window space, and it's not fun to maintain.

Progressive disclosure solves this. Keep essential instructions in SKILL.md and put detailed reference material in separate files that Claude reads only when needed.

The open standard suggests organizing your skill directory with:

- \`scripts/\` — Executable code
- \`references/\` — Additional documentation
- \`assets/\` — Images, templates, or other data files

Then in SKILL.md, link to the supporting files with clear instructions about when to load them.

In this example, Claude reads \`architecture-guide.md\` only when someone asks about system design. If they're asking where to add a component, it never loads that file. It's like having a table of contents in the context window rather than the entire document.

A good rule of thumb: keep SKILL.md under 500 lines. If you're exceeding that, consider whether the content should be split into separate reference files.

## Using Scripts Efficiently

Scripts in your skill directory can run without loading their contents into context. The script executes and only the output consumes tokens. The key instruction to include in your SKILL.md is to tell Claude to run the script, not read it.

This is particularly useful for:

- Environment validation
- Data transformations that need to be consistent
- Operations that are more reliable as tested code than generated code`,
    reflection: [
      "Think about a skill you'd like to build that involves multiple files. How would you structure the SKILL.md versus supporting reference files?",
      "Are there workflows in your team where restricting tool access with allowed-tools would add an important safety layer?",

    ],
    body: `Claude Code offers several customization options: Skills, CLAUDE.md, subagents, hooks, and MCP servers. They solve different problems, and knowing when to use each prevents you from building the wrong thing. Let's break them down.

## CLAUDE.md vs Skills

CLAUDE.md loads into every conversation, always. If you want Claude to use TypeScript strict mode in your project, put it in your CLAUDE.md file.

Skills load on demand. When Claude matches a request to a skill, that skill's instructions join the conversation. Your PR review checklist doesn't need to be in context when you're writing new code — it activates when you ask for a review.

**Use CLAUDE.md for:**

- Project-wide standards that always apply
- Constraints like "never modify the database schema"
- Framework preferences and coding style

**Use Skills for:**

- Task-specific expertise
- Knowledge that's only relevant sometimes
- Detailed procedures that would clutter every conversation

## Skills vs Subagents

Skills add knowledge to your current conversation. When a skill activates, its instructions join the existing context.

Subagents run in a separate context. They receive a task, work on it independently, and return results. They're isolated from the main conversation.

**Use Subagents when:**

- You want to delegate a task to a separate execution context
- You need different tool access than the main conversation
- You want isolation between delegated work and your main context

**Use Skills when:**

- You want to enhance Claude's knowledge for the current task
- The expertise applies throughout a conversation

## Skills vs Hooks

Hooks fire on events. A hook might run a linter every time Claude saves a file, or validate input before certain tool calls. They're event-driven.

Skills are request-driven. They activate based on what you're asking.

**Use Hooks for:**

- Operations that should run on every file save
- Validation before specific tool calls
- Automated side effects of Claude's actions

**Use Skills for:**

- Knowledge that informs how Claude handles requests
- Guidelines that affect Claude's reasoning

## Putting It All Together

A typical setup might include:

- **CLAUDE.md** — always-on project standards
- **Skills** — task-specific expertise that loads on demand
- **Hooks** — automated operations triggered by events
- **Subagents** — isolated execution contexts for delegated work
- **MCP servers** — external tools and integrations

Each handles its own specialty. Don't force everything into skills when another option fits better — and you can use multiple at a time. Skills provide automatic task-specific expertise, CLAUDE.md is for always-on instructions, subagents run in isolated contexts, hooks fire on events, and MCP provides external tools.

Use skills when you have knowledge that Claude should apply automatically when the topic is relevant, and combine them with other features for comprehensive customization.`,

    ],
    body: `Skills become much more valuable when they're shared. A PR review skill that only you use is helpful, but that same skill shared across your entire team standardizes code review and creates a consistent experience across your organization. Let's look at the different ways you can distribute skills.

## Committing Skills to Your Repository

The simplest sharing method is committing skills directly to your repository. Place them in \`.claude/skills\`, and anyone who clones the repo gets those skills automatically — no extra installation needed.

When you push updates, everyone gets them on the next pull. This approach works well for:

- Team coding standards
- Project-specific workflows
- Skills that reference your codebase structure

The \`.claude\` directory contains your agents, hooks, skills, and settings — all version-controlled and shared with the team through normal Git workflows.

## Distributing Skills Through Plugins

Plugins are a way to extend Claude Code with custom functionality designed to be shared across teams and projects. In your plugin project, create a skills directory that follows a similar file structure to the \`.claude\` directory — each skill gets its own folder with a SKILL.md file inside.

After you distribute your plugin to a marketplace, other users can discover and install it into Claude Code for themselves.

This approach is best when your skills aren't too project-specific and can be useful to community members beyond your immediate team.

## Enterprise Deployment Through Managed Settings

Administrators can deploy skills organization-wide through managed settings. Enterprise skills take the highest priority — they override personal, project, and plugin skills with the same name.

The managed settings file supports features like \`strictKnownMarketplaces\` to control where plugins can be installed from:

\`\`\`json
"strictKnownMarketplaces": [
  {
    "source": "github",
    "repo": "acme-corp/approved-plugins"
  },
  {
    "source": "npm",
    "package": "@acme-corp/compliance-plugins"
  }
]
\`\`\`

This is the right choice for mandatory standards, security requirements, compliance workflows, and coding practices that must be consistent across the organization. The keyword here is "must."

## Skills and Subagents

Here's something that surprises people: subagents don't automatically see your skills. When you delegate a task to a subagent, it starts with a fresh, clean context.

There are important distinctions to understand:

- **Built-in agents** (like Explorer, Plan, and Verify) can't access skills at all
- **Custom subagents** you define can use skills, but only when you explicitly list them
- Skills are loaded when the subagent starts, not on demand like in the main conversation

To create a custom subagent with skills, add an agent markdown file in \`.claude/agents\`. You can use the \`/agents\` command in Claude Code to create one interactively.

The generated agent file includes a \`skills\` field that lists which skills to load. Here's what the frontmatter looks like:

\`\`\`markdown
---
name: frontend-security-accessibility-reviewer
description: "Use this agent when you need to review frontend code for accessibility..."
tools: Bash, Glob, Grep, Read, WebFetch, WebSearch, Skill...
model: sonnet
color: blue
skills: accessibility-audit, performance-check
---
\`\`\`

When you delegate to this subagent, it has both skills loaded and applies them to every review. First make sure the skills exist in your \`.claude/skills\` directory, then either create a new subagent or add the \`skills\` field to an existing agent's markdown file.

This pattern works really well when:

- You want isolated task delegation with specific expertise
- Different subagents need different skills (frontend reviewer vs. backend reviewer)
- You want to enforce standards in delegated work without relying on prompts`,
    reflection: [
      "Which sharing method (repository, plugin, enterprise) makes the most sense for the skills you've been thinking about building?",

    ],
    body: `When skills don't work, the problem usually falls into one of a few categories: the skill doesn't trigger, doesn't load, has conflicts, or fails at runtime. The good news is that most fixes are pretty straightforward.

## Use the Skills Validator

The first thing to try is the agent skills verifier command. Installation steps vary by operating system, but using \`uv\` is the easiest way to get it set up quickly.

Once installed, either navigate to your skill directory or run the command from anywhere. The validator will catch structural problems before you spend time debugging other things.

## Skill Doesn't Trigger

Your skill exists and passes validation, but Claude isn't using it when you expect. The cause is almost always the description.

Claude uses semantic matching, so your request needs to overlap with the description's meaning. If there's not enough overlap, no match. Here's what to do:

- Check your description against how you're actually phrasing requests
- Add trigger phrases users would actually say
- Test with variations like "help me profile this," "why is this slow?", "make this faster"
- If any variation fails to trigger, add those keywords to your description

## Skill Doesn't Load

If your skill doesn't appear when you ask Claude "what skills are available," check these structural requirements:

- The SKILL.md file must be inside a named directory, not at the skills root
- The file name must be exactly \`SKILL.md\` — all caps on "SKILL", lowercase "md"

Run \`claude --debug\` to see loading errors. Look for messages mentioning your skill name. Sometimes this alone will point you straight to the problem.

## Wrong Skill Gets Used

If Claude uses the wrong skill or seems confused between skills, your descriptions are probably too similar. Make them distinct. Being as specific as possible doesn't just help Claude decide when to use your skill — it also prevents conflicts with other similar-sounding skills.

## Skill Priority Conflicts

If your personal skill is being ignored, an enterprise or higher-priority skill might have the same name.

For example, if there's an enterprise "code-review" skill and you also have a personal "code-review" skill, the enterprise one wins every time. Your options:

- Rename your skill to something more distinct (this is usually the easier path)
- Talk to your admin about the enterprise skill

## Plugin Skills Not Appearing

Installed a plugin but can't see its skills? Clear the cache, restart Claude Code, and reinstall.

If skills still don't appear after that, the plugin structure might be wrong. This is when the validator tool really earns its keep.

## Runtime Errors

The skill loads but fails during execution. A few common causes:

- **Missing dependencies**: If your skill uses external packages, they must be installed. Add dependency info to your skill description so Claude knows what's needed.
- **Permission issues**: Scripts need execute permission. Run \`chmod +x\` on any scripts your skill references.
- **Path separators**: Use forward slashes everywhere, even on Windows.

## Quick Troubleshooting Checklist

1. **Not triggering?** Improve your description and add trigger phrases.
