# Scaling Laws: Chinchilla, Emergent Abilities & Compute-Optimal Training

Scaling laws have fundamentally reshaped how the AI industry allocates resources, trains models, and forecasts capabilities. The discovery that language model performance follows predictable power-law relationships with compute, data, and parameters — and the subsequent debate over what "optimal" scaling means — has driven multi-billion-dollar infrastructure decisions. This article examines the key scaling results from Kaplan through Chinchilla, the contested phenomenon of emergent abilities, and the practical implications for engineering teams making model sizing decisions today.

## The Kaplan Scaling Laws

**Kaplan et al. (2020)** at OpenAI published the first systematic study of neural scaling laws for language models. Training a series of transformer language models ranging from 768 parameters to 1.5 billion, they found that cross-entropy loss $L$ follows a power law in three variables:

$$L(N) \propto N^{-0.076}$$
$$L(D) \propto D^{-0.095}$$
$$L(C) \propto C^{-0.050}$$

where $N$ is the number of non-embedding parameters, $D$ is the dataset size in tokens, and $C$ is the compute budget in FLOPs.

### Key Claims

The Kaplan paper made several influential claims:

1. **Performance is a smooth power law** in each variable when the others are not bottlenecked. There are no sharp transitions or diminishing returns at the scales tested.
2. **Model size matters more than data size**: for a fixed compute budget, it is more efficient to train a larger model on less data than a smaller model on more data. Specifically, they recommended scaling parameters roughly as $N \propto C^{0.73}$ and data as $D \propto C^{0.27}$.
3. **Architectural details matter less than scale**: within the transformer family, variations in depth, width, and attention heads had modest effects compared to total parameter count (see [Transformer Architecture](/agent-01-transformer-architecture) for how these dimensions interact).
4. **Training should be stopped early**: given fixed compute, it is better to train a large model for fewer steps than to train a smaller model to convergence.

This last point was particularly consequential. It led to the common practice (exemplified by GPT-3) of training very large models on relatively modest amounts of data — GPT-3's 175B parameters were trained on roughly 300B tokens, far from convergence.

## Chinchilla: Revising the Optimal Ratios

**Hoffmann et al. (2022)** at DeepMind challenged Kaplan's recommendations with the Chinchilla paper, "Training Compute-Optimal Large Language Models." By training over 400 models ranging from 70M to 16B parameters on 5B to 500B tokens, they derived substantially different optimal scaling ratios.

### The Chinchilla Result

Hoffmann et al. found that the compute-optimal number of parameters and tokens should scale equally with compute:

$$N_{opt} \propto C^{0.50}$$
$$D_{opt} \propto C^{0.50}$$

This means that for every doubling of model size, you should also double the training data. The practical implication was dramatic: most large models at the time were significantly undertrained relative to their parameter count.

To validate this, they trained **Chinchilla** — a 70B parameter model on 1.4 trillion tokens — and showed it outperformed the 280B parameter **Gopher** model that had been trained on only 300B tokens, despite using the same compute budget. The Chinchilla result meant that the field had been systematically overinvesting in parameters and underinvesting in data.

### Why Did Kaplan and Chinchilla Disagree?

The discrepancy between Kaplan and Chinchilla scaling ratios has been analyzed in detail. Several factors contributed:

- **Learning rate schedule**: Kaplan used a fixed learning rate schedule across all runs, while Chinchilla tuned the schedule per run. Since larger models benefit from longer warmup and different decay, Kaplan's setup may have disadvantaged larger models, making them appear less data-hungry.
- **Fit methodology**: The two papers used different parametric forms for the loss function and different fitting procedures. **Besiroglu et al. (2024)** showed that the choice of functional form significantly affects the inferred optimal ratios.
- **Scale range**: Chinchilla explored a broader range of data sizes relative to model sizes, covering more of the relevant parameter space.

The Chinchilla ratios have been broadly (though not universally) adopted. Llama 1 (**Touvron et al., 2023**) explicitly cited Chinchilla when training their 7B model on 1T tokens and their 65B model on 1.4T tokens.

### Beyond Chinchilla: Overtrained Models

Interestingly, many recent models deliberately deviate from Chinchilla-optimal ratios by training on significantly more data than the compute-optimal point would suggest. Llama 2 7B was trained on 2T tokens, and Llama 3 8B on 15T tokens — far beyond Chinchilla-optimal for their sizes.

The rationale is that **inference cost matters more than training cost** for models that will serve billions of queries. A smaller model trained on more data (overtrained relative to Chinchilla) may have higher training cost per quality point, but its lower inference cost makes it more economical at deployment scale. This insight, formalized as **inference-aware scaling** by **Sardana and Frankle (2023)**, has become standard practice. For a detailed treatment of the inference cost structure that motivates overtraining, see [Inference Optimization: KV Cache, Quantization & Speculative Decoding](/agent-05-inference-optimization).

```python
# Chinchilla-optimal estimates
def chinchilla_optimal(compute_flops):
    """Estimate Chinchilla-optimal model size and token count."""
    # Approximate: N_opt ~ 0.0592 * C^0.50, D_opt ~ 0.0592 * C^0.50
    # Using the simplified equal-scaling rule
    N_opt = (compute_flops / 6) ** 0.5  # 6 FLOPs per parameter per token
    D_opt = N_opt  # Equal scaling
    return N_opt, D_opt

# For a given compute budget
C = 6e23  # ~GPT-3 scale compute
N, D = chinchilla_optimal(C)
print(f"Optimal params: {N/1e9:.1f}B, Optimal tokens: {D/1e12:.2f}T")
```

## Test-Time Compute Scaling

The scaling laws discussed above all address **train-time compute** — FLOPs spent before the model is deployed. A paradigm shift emerged with **OpenAI's o1 model (2024)**, which demonstrated that allocating additional compute at **inference time** can yield dramatic accuracy gains on reasoning tasks, effectively creating a second axis of scaling.

### The Inference-Time Reasoning Paradigm

Rather than producing an answer in a single forward pass, o1-style models generate extended chains of internal reasoning tokens before arriving at a final response. The model "thinks longer" on harder problems, spending more inference FLOPs in proportion to problem difficulty. This introduces a new scaling law:

$$\text{Accuracy}(T) \propto \log(T)$$

where $T$ is the number of reasoning tokens generated at inference time. **Snell et al. (2024)** formalized this as "scaling compute-optimal test-time compute," showing that on math and coding benchmarks, doubling inference-time tokens yields consistent accuracy improvements that follow predictable log-linear curves — analogous to the Kaplan/Chinchilla laws for training.

### Rebalancing the Compute Equation

This changes the fundamental resource allocation question. Under the classical framework, the only way to improve a deployed model was to train a better one. Under the test-time compute paradigm, teams face a three-way tradeoff:

1. **Train a larger model** (more parameters, more train-time FLOPs)
2. **Train longer on more data** (more tokens, same parameters)
3. **Think longer at inference** (more reasoning tokens per query)

**Lightman et al. (2023)** demonstrated that process reward models — which supervise each step of a chain-of-thought rather than just the final answer — enable more efficient test-time scaling by providing denser feedback signals. Combined with search strategies like beam search or best-of-N sampling over reasoning chains, a smaller base model with extended inference can match or exceed a much larger model's single-pass performance.

The practical implication is significant: for reasoning-heavy workloads (mathematics, code generation, complex analysis), it may be more cost-effective to deploy a 70B model that generates 10,000 reasoning tokens than to train and deploy a 400B model that answers in a single pass. This tradeoff depends on query volume — test-time compute costs scale linearly with requests, while training is a one-time cost (see [Inference Optimization](/agent-05-inference-optimization) for the serving cost analysis).

### Limits of Test-Time Scaling

Test-time compute scaling is not universal. **Brown et al. (2024)** showed that on tasks dominated by factual recall rather than reasoning (e.g., trivia, entity recognition), additional reasoning tokens provide minimal benefit — the knowledge is either in the model's parameters or it is not. Test-time scaling is most effective on tasks that benefit from decomposition: multi-step math, planning, code debugging, and logical reasoning. This suggests that test-time and train-time compute are complementary rather than substitutional: training determines *what the model knows*, while test-time compute determines *how well it can use what it knows*.

## Scaling Laws for Data Quality

The Chinchilla framework treats all training tokens as interchangeable, but a growing body of work demonstrates that **data quality** acts as a multiplier on the effective compute budget, fundamentally altering the scaling ratios.

### The Phi Series: Textbook-Quality Data

Microsoft's Phi model series provided striking evidence that curated, high-quality data can substitute for raw scale. **Gunasekar et al. (2023)** trained **Phi-1**, a 1.3B parameter model, on only 7B tokens of "textbook-quality" data for code — synthetically generated and carefully filtered to emphasize clear, pedagogical examples. Despite its small size, Phi-1 matched or exceeded models 10x larger trained on standard web-scraped code data.

**Li et al. (2023)** extended this with **Phi-2** (2.7B parameters), trained on 1.4T tokens of synthetic textbook and exercise data mixed with filtered web content. Phi-2 matched the performance of Llama-2 70B on several reasoning benchmarks — a 25x parameter gap closed entirely by data quality. **Abdin et al. (2024)** continued with **Phi-3** (3.8B parameters), showing consistent gains from quality-focused data pipelines.

### Modifying the Chinchilla Ratios

These results suggest a modified scaling law that accounts for data quality:

$$L(N, D, Q) \propto N^{-\alpha} \cdot (D \cdot Q)^{-\beta}$$

where $Q$ is a data quality multiplier. When $Q$ is high (curated, textbook-quality data), the effective dataset size $D \cdot Q$ is much larger than the raw token count, shifting the Chinchilla-optimal balance toward smaller models trained on fewer but better tokens. **Sorscher et al. (2022)** formalized this, showing that data pruning can change the scaling exponent itself — moving from a power-law regime to an exponential improvement regime when the lowest-quality data is removed.

In practice, this means that the Chinchilla ratios ($N \propto C^{0.5}$, $D \propto C^{0.5}$) represent a **lower bound** on data efficiency. Teams with access to high-quality curated or synthetic data can achieve the same loss with substantially less compute — or equivalently, achieve lower loss at the same compute budget. For details on quality filtering pipelines and data curation strategies, see [Pre-training: Data Curation, Objectives & Curriculum](/agent-06-pretraining-data).

## Scaling Laws for Post-Training

Pre-training scaling laws govern base model quality, but the relationship between base model capability and the effectiveness of post-training alignment (RLHF, DPO, instruction tuning) follows its own scaling dynamics.

### Reward Model Scaling

**Gao et al. (2023)** studied scaling laws for reward models used in RLHF, finding that reward model accuracy scales log-linearly with both parameter count and the volume of human preference data:

$$\text{RM Accuracy} \propto \alpha \log(N_{RM}) + \beta \log(D_{pref})$$

where $N_{RM}$ is the reward model size and $D_{pref}$ is the number of preference comparisons. Crucially, they found that the reward model should be **comparable in size to the policy model** — using a small reward model to align a large policy leads to reward hacking, where the policy exploits blind spots in the reward model rather than genuinely improving.

### Preference Data Volume

For DPO and RLHF, the volume of preference data exhibits diminishing returns, but the quality threshold is high. **Ivison et al. (2023)** found that 10K high-quality preference pairs can outperform 100K noisy ones, echoing the data quality findings from pre-training. The scaling curve for alignment data is approximately:

$$\Delta_{\text{alignment}} \propto D_{pref}^{0.3} \cdot Q_{pref}^{0.7}$$

where the quality exponent dominates the volume exponent — a sharper quality dependence than in pre-training.

### Base Model Capability and Alignment Effectiveness

A critical finding across multiple studies is that **alignment effectiveness scales with base model capability**. **Ouyang et al. (2022)** showed that InstructGPT's gains over the base GPT-3 were proportionally larger for the 175B model than for the 1.3B model. The same quantity and quality of alignment data produces larger absolute improvements when applied to stronger base models.

This creates a compounding effect: investment in pre-training quality amplifies the return on post-training investment, and vice versa. Teams should not treat pre-training and post-training budgets as independent — the optimal allocation depends on the relative cost curves of both stages. The interaction between pre-training data composition and alignment outcomes is explored further in [Pre-training: Data Curation, Objectives & Curriculum](/agent-06-pretraining-data).

## Emergent Abilities: Real or Mirage?

One of the most debated phenomena in scaling research is the concept of **emergent abilities** — capabilities that appear to arise suddenly and unpredictably as models scale, absent at smaller scales and present at larger ones.

### The Case For Emergence

**Wei et al. (2022)** at Google documented over 130 tasks where model performance appeared to exhibit a sharp phase transition. On tasks like multi-step arithmetic, word unscrambling, and certain reasoning benchmarks, small models performed at or near chance level, while models above a critical scale showed sudden jumps in performance.

This was exciting because it suggested that scaling alone could unlock qualitatively new capabilities — and troubling because it implied that forecasting model capabilities from smaller-scale experiments might be fundamentally unreliable.

The paper defined emergent abilities as those that are "not present in smaller models but are present in larger models," with the key feature being the apparent **unpredictability** of when they would appear.

### The Case Against: A Measurement Artifact

**Schaeffer et al. (2023)** challenged this narrative in "Are Emergent Abilities of Large Language Models a Mirage?" They argued that the apparent emergence was an artifact of the evaluation metrics, not a fundamental property of the models.

Their central argument: when researchers used **nonlinear or discontinuous metrics** (like exact-match accuracy), performance appeared to jump sharply. But when the same models were evaluated with **continuous metrics** (like token-level log-probability or Brier score), performance improved smoothly and predictably with scale.

Consider a task where a model must produce a multi-token answer exactly right to score 1.0 (and scores 0.0 otherwise). Even if each individual token's probability improves gradually with scale, the probability of getting all tokens correct can appear to jump — it is the product of many gradually improving probabilities, which produces a sigmoid-like curve that looks like a phase transition.

```python
import numpy as np

def exact_match_probability(per_token_accuracy, num_tokens):
    """
    If per-token accuracy improves gradually,
    exact-match accuracy exhibits apparent 'emergence.'
    """
    return per_token_accuracy ** num_tokens

# Per-token accuracy improving linearly with log(scale)
scales = np.logspace(8, 11, 50)  # 100M to 100B params
per_token_acc = 0.5 + 0.1 * np.log10(scales / 1e8)
per_token_acc = np.clip(per_token_acc, 0, 0.99)

# 8-token answer: smooth input -> sharp-looking output
exact_match = exact_match_probability(per_token_acc, num_tokens=8)
# This curve looks like a phase transition but is fully predictable
```

### Capability Elicitation: Unlocking Hidden Abilities

A parallel line of research has complicated the emergence narrative from a different angle. **Wei et al. (2024)** and **Srivastava et al. (2024)** showed that capabilities which appear absent under naive evaluation can often be **elicited** through improved prompting, scaffolding, or chain-of-thought decomposition. A model that scores near zero on a multi-step reasoning task with direct prompting may score above 80% when given a structured chain-of-thought template or when the task is decomposed into subtasks by an external scaffold.

This suggests that the apparent emergence threshold is at least partially a function of the **evaluation protocol**, not just the model's intrinsic capability. The capability may be latent in the model's representations but inaccessible without the right interface. **Lu et al. (2024)** formalized this as the distinction between a model's **intrinsic capability** (what it can do with optimal elicitation) and its **expressed capability** (what it demonstrates under a given prompt). The gap between these two narrows with better prompting techniques and widens with task complexity — meaning that emergence claims based on simple prompting may systematically underestimate smaller models.

This finding has practical importance: before concluding that a model lacks a capability, teams should invest in prompt engineering and scaffolding. The transformer's internal representations (see [Transformer Architecture](/agent-01-transformer-architecture) for how attention patterns encode structured information) may support capabilities that only surface with the right elicitation strategy.

### Current Consensus

The field has largely accepted that Schaeffer et al. identified a real methodological issue: many apparent emergent abilities are indeed metric artifacts. The capability elicitation research adds a second layer: even beyond metric choice, the prompting and scaffolding strategy significantly affects where the apparent capability threshold falls. However, this does not fully resolve the debate:

- **Some capabilities may still exhibit genuine nonlinear scaling**, particularly those involving qualitative changes in the model's reasoning strategy (e.g., switching from pattern matching to chain-of-thought reasoning).
- **In-context learning** itself is arguably emergent — small models barely benefit from few-shot examples, while large models show dramatic improvements. **Olsson et al. (2022)** identified specific attention patterns ("induction heads") that form during training and may underlie this capability.
- **Capability elicitation** shifts the question from "at what scale does this ability appear?" to "at what scale can this ability be elicited with reasonable effort?" — a more nuanced and practically useful framing.
- The **practical** question remains: even if the underlying metrics are smooth and elicitation narrows the gap, the user-facing experience of a model that goes from 5% to 95% exact-match accuracy on arithmetic still feels like a qualitative jump.

## Compute-Optimal Training in Practice

Translating scaling laws into practical training decisions requires grappling with several additional considerations beyond the idealized Chinchilla framework.

### The Compute Frontier

At any given time, the industry's compute frontier — the maximum available FLOPs for a single training run — determines the largest feasible model. As of early 2025, frontier training runs consume on the order of $10^{25}$ to $10^{26}$ FLOPs, using tens of thousands of GPUs for months. Industry estimates for next-generation frontier runs (2025-2026) push toward $10^{26}$ to $10^{27}$ FLOPs, driven by clusters exceeding 100,000 GPUs and the deployment of next-generation accelerators (NVIDIA B200, Google TPU v6). At these scales, even small improvements in MFU or data quality translate to enormous absolute gains — and the interaction with test-time compute scaling (discussed above) means that the effective compute envelope extends well beyond the training budget alone.

For teams not operating at the frontier, the relevant question is: given my compute budget (say, 64 A100 GPUs for 2 weeks), what is the best model I can train? Scaling laws provide direct guidance:

```python
def compute_budget(num_gpus, gpu_flops, utilization, hours):
    """Estimate total training FLOPs."""
    seconds = hours * 3600
    return num_gpus * gpu_flops * utilization * seconds

# 64 A100s for 2 weeks at 50% MFU
C = compute_budget(
    num_gpus=64,
    gpu_flops=312e12,   # A100 bf16 peak
    utilization=0.50,    # Model FLOPs Utilization
    hours=14 * 24        # 2 weeks
)
print(f"Compute budget: {C:.2e} FLOPs")
# Use Chinchilla ratios to size model and data accordingly
```

### Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU)

**Chowdhery et al. (2022)** introduced Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU) as a metric for how efficiently training hardware is utilized. MFU measures the ratio of observed throughput to the theoretical maximum, accounting only for model FLOPs (not communication, data loading, etc.).

State-of-the-art training systems achieve 40-60% MFU. The gap from 100% comes from:

- **Communication overhead**: gradient synchronization across GPUs via all-reduce
- **Pipeline bubbles**: in pipeline parallelism, some GPUs are idle while waiting for activations or gradients
- **Memory operations**: attention, normalization, and activation recomputation
- **Data loading**: tokenization, batching, and data transfer

### Repeat Tokens and Data Constraints

A practical challenge for Chinchilla-optimal training is that high-quality training data is finite. **Muennighoff et al. (2023)** studied the effect of repeating data and found that repeating tokens is less efficient than unique tokens, with diminishing returns after approximately 4 epochs. This creates a ceiling: if you cannot source enough unique tokens, you may be forced to either use a smaller model than compute-optimal or accept suboptimal data efficiency.

This data wall has driven significant investment in synthetic data generation, multilingual data sourcing, and code/math data as supplements to web text. The full data curation pipeline — including deduplication, quality filtering, and domain mixing strategies — is covered in [Pre-training: Data Curation, Objectives & Curriculum](/agent-06-pretraining-data).

## Scaling Beyond Language Loss

Scaling laws were originally characterized in terms of cross-entropy loss on held-out text. But practitioners care about downstream task performance, not perplexity. The relationship between pre-training loss and downstream performance is complex:

- **Log-linear relationships**: for many benchmarks, downstream accuracy scales log-linearly with pre-training loss, meaning each halving of loss improvement requires a 10x increase in compute (**Gadre et al., 2024**).
- **Task-dependent scaling**: some tasks (factual recall, translation) improve steadily with scale, while others (certain reasoning tasks) improve faster or slower than the loss would predict.
- **Post-training amplification**: RLHF and instruction tuning can significantly shift the mapping between pre-training quality and downstream performance, sometimes allowing smaller well-tuned models to match larger base models (**Ouyang et al., 2022**).

## Scaling Laws for Other Modalities

The power-law scaling framework has been extended beyond language:

- **Vision transformers**: **Zhai et al. (2022)** showed that ViT models follow similar scaling laws, with performance scaling as a power law in model size and data.
- **Multimodal models**: scaling laws for vision-language models have been studied by **Cherti et al. (2023)** in the context of CLIP-style contrastive learning.
- **Code models**: **Allal et al. (2023)** found that code generation follows scaling laws similar to natural language, but with higher data efficiency (code is more structured).

## Implications for Model Sizing Decisions

For engineering teams, the scaling laws literature provides actionable guidance:

### When to Scale Up vs. Scale Down

1. **If you are compute-constrained** (fixed GPU budget), use Chinchilla ratios to balance model size and data. A 3B model trained on 60B tokens will generally outperform a 7B model trained on 25B tokens.

2. **If you are deploying at scale** (many inference queries), consider overtraining a smaller model. The inference cost savings from a 3B vs. 7B model may justify 2-3x the compute-optimal training cost.

3. **If you need specific capabilities** (math, code, multilingual), invest in domain data quality rather than raw scale. Data quality scaling (**Longpre et al., 2023**) shows that curated data can substitute for 5-10x more uncurated data.

### The Diminishing Returns Landscape

Perhaps the most important takeaway from scaling laws is quantitative: improvements are **logarithmic** in compute. Cutting loss by half requires roughly 100x more compute. This means that the marginal value of each additional dollar of training compute decreases predictably, and at some point, investment in better data, algorithms, or post-training becomes more efficient than raw scaling.

## Summary and Key Takeaways

- **Kaplan et al. (2020)** established that language model loss follows power laws in parameters, data, and compute, but overemphasized parameter scaling relative to data.
- **Chinchilla (Hoffmann et al., 2022)** corrected the balance, showing that parameters and data should scale equally with compute, meaning most prior models were significantly undertrained.
- **Inference-aware scaling** favors overtraining smaller models relative to Chinchilla-optimal, since deployment cost often dominates training cost.
- **Test-time compute scaling** introduces a second axis: models that "think longer" at inference time (o1-style reasoning) can trade inference FLOPs for accuracy on reasoning tasks, fundamentally expanding the compute optimization space beyond training alone.
- **Data quality scaling** (the Phi series and related work) shows that curated, textbook-quality data can substitute for 10-25x more parameters, modifying the Chinchilla ratios when high-quality data is available.
- **Post-training scaling** follows its own laws: reward model size should match policy model size, preference data quality dominates volume, and alignment effectiveness compounds with base model capability.
- **Emergent abilities** as described by Wei et al. (2022) are at least partially an artifact of discontinuous evaluation metrics (Schaeffer et al., 2023), and capability elicitation research (2024) further shows that improved prompting and scaffolding can unlock abilities that appear absent under naive evaluation.
- **Data quality and availability** increasingly constrain scaling, as the field approaches the limits of unique, high-quality web text.
- Scaling laws provide a quantitative framework for resource allocation, but their logarithmic nature means that algorithmic improvements, data quality, and post-training methods become increasingly important relative to raw compute at the frontier.
- For practical model sizing, teams should consider their full cost structure (training + inference + data acquisition) rather than optimizing for training efficiency alone.
