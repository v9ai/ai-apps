# Tokenization: BPE, SentencePiece & Vocabulary Design

Tokenization is the critical interface between raw text and neural language models, yet it remains one of the most underexamined components of the LLM pipeline. The choice of tokenization algorithm, vocabulary size, and training data directly impacts model quality, inference speed, multilinguality, and even what tasks a model can perform. This article provides a deep technical examination of modern tokenization methods, from the foundational Byte-Pair Encoding algorithm through SentencePiece and tiktoken, and explores the engineering tradeoffs that shape vocabulary design decisions in production systems.

## Why Tokenization Matters

A language model does not see characters or words — it sees token IDs. Every design choice in the tokenizer cascades through the entire system:

- **Sequence length**: A tokenizer that encodes English text at 4 characters per token produces sequences half the length of one that averages 2 characters per token. Since transformer cost is $O(n^2)$ in sequence length, this directly impacts training and inference cost.
- **Vocabulary coverage**: Tokens the model has never seen during training are broken into subtokens or individual bytes, often degrading quality. Languages underrepresented in the tokenizer's training data suffer disproportionately.
- **Numerical reasoning**: How numbers are tokenized (as individual digits, multi-digit tokens, or inconsistent chunks) affects arithmetic and numerical understanding.
- **Code generation**: Whitespace handling, indentation consistency, and special character tokenization all affect code quality.

Despite its importance, tokenization is often treated as a preprocessing step and given far less attention than architecture or training methodology. As **Kudo and Richardson (2018)** noted, "the choice of subword segmentation algorithm significantly affects the quality of the resulting model."

## Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE)

Byte-Pair Encoding, originally a data compression algorithm by **Gage (1994)**, was adapted for neural machine translation by **Sennrich et al. (2016)** and has become the dominant tokenization approach for LLMs.

### Algorithm

BPE starts with a base vocabulary (typically individual characters or bytes) and iteratively merges the most frequent adjacent pair of tokens:

```python
def learn_bpe(corpus, num_merges):
    """Simplified BPE training algorithm."""
    # Initialize: split each word into characters + end-of-word marker
    vocab = {}
    for word, freq in corpus.items():
        vocab[tuple(word) + ('</w>',)] = freq

    merges = []
    for i in range(num_merges):
        # Count all adjacent pairs
        pairs = {}
        for tokens, freq in vocab.items():
            for j in range(len(tokens) - 1):
                pair = (tokens[j], tokens[j + 1])
                pairs[pair] = pairs.get(pair, 0) + freq

        if not pairs:
            break

        # Find most frequent pair
        best_pair = max(pairs, key=pairs.get)
        merges.append(best_pair)

        # Merge the best pair everywhere in the vocabulary
        new_vocab = {}
        for tokens, freq in vocab.items():
            new_tokens = []
            i = 0
            while i < len(tokens):
                if (i < len(tokens) - 1 and
                    tokens[i] == best_pair[0] and
                    tokens[i + 1] == best_pair[1]):
                    new_tokens.append(best_pair[0] + best_pair[1])
                    i += 2
                else:
                    new_tokens.append(tokens[i])
                    i += 1
            new_vocab[tuple(new_tokens)] = freq
        vocab = new_vocab

    return merges
```

At encoding time, the learned merge operations are applied greedily in the order they were learned:

```python
def encode_bpe(text, merges):
    """Apply BPE merges to tokenize text."""
    tokens = list(text) + ['</w>']

    for pair in merges:
        i = 0
        new_tokens = []
        while i < len(tokens):
            if (i < len(tokens) - 1 and
                tokens[i] == pair[0] and
                tokens[i + 1] == pair[1]):
                new_tokens.append(pair[0] + pair[1])
                i += 2
            else:
                new_tokens.append(tokens[i])
                i += 1
        tokens = new_tokens

    return tokens
```

### Properties of BPE

BPE has several characteristics that explain its dominance:

- **Deterministic given the merge table**: the same input always produces the same output, which is important for reproducibility and caching.
- **Frequency-adaptive**: common words become single tokens, while rare words are decomposed into subword units. The word "running" might be a single token, while "pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis" would be split into several.
- **Open vocabulary**: by starting from bytes or characters, BPE can encode any input, eliminating the out-of-vocabulary problem that plagued word-level tokenizers.

## WordPiece

**WordPiece** (**Schuster and Nakajima, 2012**), used by BERT and related models, is similar to BPE but differs in its merge criterion. Instead of merging the most frequent pair, WordPiece merges the pair that maximizes the likelihood of the training data under a unigram language model:

$$\text{score}(a, b) = \frac{\text{freq}(ab)}{\text{freq}(a) \times \text{freq}(b)}$$

This tends to produce slightly different vocabularies than BPE — WordPiece prefers merges that create tokens with high mutual information rather than simply high frequency. In practice, the differences are modest for large vocabularies.

WordPiece uses a "##" prefix to denote continuation tokens (tokens that do not start a new word), e.g., "playing" might be tokenized as `["play", "##ing"]`. This explicit word boundary marking differs from BPE's approach and has implications for tasks that need to reconstruct word boundaries.

## Unigram Language Model

**Kudo (2018)** proposed the Unigram Language Model approach, which takes a fundamentally different strategy: instead of building up a vocabulary through merges, it starts with a large vocabulary and iteratively prunes it.

The algorithm:

1. Start with a large seed vocabulary (all substrings up to some length, or all frequent substrings).
2. For each candidate vocabulary, compute the optimal segmentation of the training corpus using the Viterbi algorithm under a unigram language model.
3. Remove tokens that contribute least to the corpus likelihood (measured by the increase in loss when removed).
4. Repeat until the desired vocabulary size is reached.

```python
def viterbi_tokenize(text, vocab_with_scores):
    """Find the highest-probability segmentation under a unigram model."""
    n = len(text)
    best_score = [float('-inf')] * (n + 1)
    best_score[0] = 0.0
    best_edge = [None] * (n + 1)

    for end in range(1, n + 1):
        for begin in range(end):
            substr = text[begin:end]
            if substr in vocab_with_scores:
                score = best_score[begin] + vocab_with_scores[substr]
                if score > best_score[end]:
                    best_score[end] = score
                    best_edge[end] = begin

    # Backtrack to find segmentation
    tokens = []
    pos = n
    while pos > 0:
        begin = best_edge[pos]
        tokens.append(text[begin:pos])
        pos = begin
    return list(reversed(tokens))
```

A distinctive feature of the Unigram model is that it can produce **multiple segmentations** with different probabilities, enabling **subword regularization** — sampling different segmentations during training as a form of data augmentation. **Kudo (2018)** showed this improves robustness, particularly for low-resource languages.

## SentencePiece

**SentencePiece** (**Kudo and Richardson, 2018**) is not a tokenization algorithm per se but a library and framework that treats tokenization as a language-independent, purely data-driven process. Its key innovations:

### Whitespace as a Token

SentencePiece treats the input as a raw unicode string and replaces spaces with a special unicode character (U+2581, the "lower one-eighth block" character, rendered as `_`). This means whitespace is explicitly part of the vocabulary rather than being used as a word boundary:

```
Input:  "Hello World"
SentencePiece: ["_Hello", "_World"]
```

This design eliminates the need for language-specific pre-tokenization (splitting on whitespace and punctuation), making SentencePiece truly language-agnostic. Languages like Chinese, Japanese, and Thai, which do not use whitespace to separate words, are handled naturally.

### Supported Algorithms

SentencePiece supports both BPE and Unigram models as backend algorithms. In practice, most LLMs that use SentencePiece (Llama, T5, mBART) use it with BPE, while some use the Unigram model.

### Byte Fallback

SentencePiece's byte fallback mode ensures that any unicode character can be encoded by falling back to individual bytes when a character is not in the vocabulary. This is implemented by adding 256 byte tokens (`<0x00>` through `<0xFF>`) to the vocabulary. The byte fallback ensures complete coverage without needing an `<unk>` token.

## tiktoken and GPT Tokenization

OpenAI's **tiktoken** is a fast BPE implementation used by GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and related models. Its key characteristics:

### Byte-Level BPE

tiktoken operates on bytes rather than unicode characters. The input text is first encoded to UTF-8, and BPE operates on the byte sequence. This automatically handles any unicode input without requiring a separate byte fallback mechanism.

### Regex-Based Pre-Tokenization

Before applying BPE, tiktoken splits the input using a regex pattern that separates text into categories:

```python
# Approximate GPT-4 pre-tokenization pattern
import regex
GPT4_PATTERN = r"""'(?i:[sdmt]|ll|ve|re)|[^\r\n\p{L}\p{N}]?+\p{L}+|\p{N}{1,3}| ?[^\s\p{L}\p{N}]++[\r\n]*|\s*[\r\n]|\s+(?!\S)|\s+"""
```

This pre-tokenization step prevents BPE from merging tokens across certain boundaries — for example, it prevents a space at the end of one word from merging with the first letter of the next word. This produces more linguistically sensible tokens.

### Performance

tiktoken is implemented in Rust and is significantly faster than the original Python BPE implementations. Tokenization speed matters at serving time, where every millisecond of latency counts, and during data preprocessing for training, where trillions of tokens must be encoded.

```python
import tiktoken

enc = tiktoken.encoding_for_model("gpt-4")
tokens = enc.encode("Hello, world! This is a test.")
print(f"Tokens: {tokens}")
print(f"Decoded: {enc.decode(tokens)}")
print(f"Token strings: {[enc.decode([t]) for t in tokens]}")
```

## Vocabulary Size Tradeoffs

The choice of vocabulary size is one of the most consequential tokenization decisions, and there is no universally optimal answer.

### Small Vocabularies (4K-16K tokens)

- **Pro**: Smaller embedding matrices, lower memory footprint, more compositional (the model must learn to compose meaning from smaller units).
- **Con**: Longer sequences (more tokens per text), higher inference cost, potentially worse performance on tasks requiring whole-word understanding.

### Medium Vocabularies (32K-64K tokens)

- **Pro**: Good balance of sequence length and embedding size. Most modern LLMs use this range (Llama: 32K, GPT-4: ~100K, Claude: ~100K).
- **Con**: May still fragment rare words and non-English text.

### Large Vocabularies (100K-250K tokens)

- **Pro**: Shorter sequences, better coverage of multilingual text, specialized tokens for code and structured data.
- **Con**: Larger embedding matrices (which can dominate parameter count for smaller models), more tokens with very low training frequency (potentially undertrained embeddings).

### The Embedding Tax

For a model with hidden dimension $d$ and vocabulary size $V$, the embedding and output projection matrices together have $2Vd$ parameters. For a 7B model with $d = 4096$ and $V = 100000$, that is $2 \times 100000 \times 4096 = 819M$ parameters — about 12% of total parameters. For smaller models, this fraction grows, making vocabulary size a critical architectural parameter.

## Multilingual Tokenization Challenges

Tokenization quality varies dramatically across languages, and this variation is a major source of cross-lingual performance disparities.

### The Fertility Problem

**Petrov et al. (2023)** documented that GPT-4's tokenizer requires 2-10x more tokens to encode the same semantic content in non-English languages compared to English. For example, encoding the equivalent text in Burmese or Tibetan may require 10x the tokens of English, meaning:

- Users pay 10x more per API call
- The effective context window is 10x smaller
- Latency is proportionally higher

This disparity stems from the tokenizer's training data composition. If the BPE training corpus is 90% English, the learned merges will predominantly benefit English text, and other languages will be segmented into shorter, less meaningful units.

### Addressing Multilingual Imbalance

Several approaches have been developed:

1. **Balanced training data**: ensuring the BPE training corpus has adequate representation of all target languages. **Conneau et al. (2020)** in XLM-R used exponential smoothing to upweight low-resource languages during tokenizer training.

2. **Language-specific pre-tokenization**: applying language-specific word segmentation before BPE. This helps for languages like Chinese (character segmentation) and Japanese (morphological analysis).

3. **Larger vocabularies**: increasing vocabulary size disproportionately benefits non-English languages by allowing more language-specific tokens.

4. **Separate tokenizers per language**: some multilingual systems use different tokenizers for different languages, though this complicates the model architecture.

## Special Topics in Tokenization

### Number Tokenization

How numbers are tokenized has outsized impact on arithmetic capability. If the number "12345" is tokenized as `["123", "45"]`, the model must learn that the boundary between tokens has no mathematical significance — a challenging implicit task.

Several approaches have been explored:

- **Individual digit tokenization**: always splitting numbers into individual digits, as used by some math-focused models.
- **Right-to-left digit grouping**: **Nogueira et al. (2021)** showed that reversing the digit order during tokenization improved arithmetic.
- **Fixed-width tokenization**: using consistent grouping (e.g., 3 digits per token) to align token boundaries with mathematical structure.

### Code Tokenization

Tokenizers designed for natural language often handle code poorly:

- **Indentation**: Python's significant whitespace may be tokenized inconsistently, with different numbers of spaces mapping to different token sequences.
- **Identifiers**: camelCase and snake_case variable names may be split at arbitrary points.
- **Special characters**: characters common in code (`{}`, `->`, `=>`, `::`) may not be single tokens.

Models designed for code (CodeLlama, StarCoder) typically train their tokenizers on code-heavy corpora to ensure sensible code tokenization.

### Adding Special Tokens

Modern LLMs use various special tokens for control and formatting:

```python
special_tokens = {
    "<|begin_of_text|>": "Start of document",
    "<|end_of_text|>": "End of document",
    "<|start_header_id|>": "Start of role header",
    "<|end_header_id|>": "End of role header",
    "<|eot_id|>": "End of turn",
    "<|python_tag|>": "Start of tool call",
}
```

These tokens are added to the vocabulary after BPE training and initialized with random or zero embeddings. They are learned during fine-tuning. The design of special token schemes has become an important aspect of chat model development.

## Tokenization-Free Approaches

A growing line of research seeks to eliminate the tokenization step entirely:

### Byte-Level Models

**Xue et al. (2022)** with ByT5 and **Yu et al. (2023)** with MegaByte showed that models operating directly on bytes can achieve competitive performance, particularly for multilingual and noise-robust applications.

The challenge is sequence length: byte-level sequences are 3-5x longer than token-level sequences, making the $O(n^2)$ attention cost prohibitive. MegaByte addresses this with a hierarchical architecture that processes patches of bytes locally and attends across patches globally.

More recently, Meta's **Byte Latent Transformer (BLT)** (**Pagnoni et al., 2024**) advanced the byte-level paradigm by introducing *dynamic patching* — rather than using fixed-size byte patches, BLT groups bytes into variable-length patches based on the entropy of the next byte. High-entropy boundaries (where the next byte is hard to predict) trigger patch boundaries, producing patches that roughly correspond to linguistically meaningful units. BLT matches tokenizer-based LLM performance at scales up to 8B parameters while eliminating the tokenization step entirely. This is significant because it demonstrates, for the first time at meaningful scale, that the inductive bias introduced by a learned tokenizer is not strictly necessary — the model can learn its own segmentation implicitly. BLT also exhibits stronger robustness to noisy inputs and improved performance on orthographically unusual text, since there is no vocabulary mismatch to cause degradation.

### Character-Level Models

**Tay et al. (2022)** explored character-level transformers and found them competitive at sufficient scale, especially for tasks requiring character-level understanding (spelling, morphology, phonetics).

These approaches remain niche but may become more practical as attention efficiency improves (through Flash Attention, linear attention approximations, or state-space models).

## Multimodal Tokenization

As language models expand beyond text to process images, audio, and video, tokenization has become a multimodal problem. The core challenge is the same as in text: convert continuous, high-dimensional input into a discrete sequence of tokens that a transformer can process. But the solutions look very different for each modality.

### Vision Tokenization

Vision transformers (ViTs) tokenize images by dividing them into fixed-size patches — typically 14x14 or 16x16 pixels — and projecting each patch through a linear embedding layer to produce a token vector. A 224x224 image at 14x14 patch size yields 256 visual tokens. This patch embedding is the visual analogue of a text embedding lookup: it maps raw input to the token dimension the transformer expects.

Multimodal LLMs like LLaVA, GPT-4V, and Gemini use a pretrained vision encoder (commonly a ViT trained with contrastive objectives) to produce visual token sequences that are then injected into the language model's token stream. The vision encoder acts as the "tokenizer" for images. **SigLIP** (**Zhai et al., 2023**), a sigmoid-loss variant of CLIP, has become a popular choice for the visual encoder in recent multimodal models because its training objective scales more efficiently to large batch sizes and produces representations well-suited to language model consumption.

The number of visual tokens per image is a critical engineering parameter. High-resolution processing demands more tokens — Gemini 1.5 Pro, for instance, uses dynamic tiling to represent high-resolution images as sequences of hundreds of visual tokens. This directly trades off against context window budget, since every visual token displaces a text token. Techniques like **Perceiver resampler** cross-attention (used in Flamingo) and **abstractor** modules compress the visual token sequence to a fixed, smaller number of tokens, limiting the context window cost regardless of image resolution (see [Article 49: Vision-Language Models](./agent-49-vision-language-models.md) for architectural details on visual encoders and their integration with language models).

### Audio Tokenization

Audio tokenization takes two distinct approaches depending on whether the goal is understanding or generation.

For **speech understanding** (ASR, spoken language understanding), models like Whisper extract log-mel spectrogram features from raw audio — typically 80 or 128 mel-frequency bins computed over 25ms windows with 10ms stride. These spectral features are then processed by a convolutional stem that downsamples the time dimension before feeding into a transformer encoder. Each resulting token represents roughly 40-80ms of audio. This is functionally equivalent to text tokenization: converting a continuous signal into a sequence of discrete representations at a practical granularity (see [Article 50: Audio & Speech AI](./agent-50-audio-speech-ai.md) for a full treatment of Whisper's architecture and speech processing pipelines).

For **audio generation** and speech-to-speech models, neural audio codecs like **EnCodec** (**Defossez et al., 2022**) and **SoundStorm** tokenize audio into discrete codes using residual vector quantization (RVQ). EnCodec compresses 24kHz audio to as few as 1.5 kbps, producing a hierarchy of discrete token streams at different quantization levels. Models like AudioLM and VALL-E consume and generate these discrete audio tokens, enabling audio modeling with the same autoregressive or masked-prediction objectives used for text.

### Unifying Modalities in a Single Sequence

The dominant integration pattern in multimodal models is "early fusion" at the token level: visual tokens, audio tokens, and text tokens are concatenated into a single sequence and processed by a shared transformer backbone. This requires that all modalities produce tokens in the same embedding dimension, but it does not require a shared vocabulary — special separator tokens delineate modality boundaries.

Gemini takes this approach most aggressively, interleaving image, audio, video, and text tokens in a single context. The tokenization choices for each modality directly determine the total sequence length and, consequently, what fits within the context window. A 30-second audio clip at 50 tokens/second consumes 1,500 tokens — the same as roughly 6,000 characters of English text. These budget constraints make efficient multimodal tokenization an active engineering concern, with recent work focused on adaptive token counts per modality based on information density.

## Tokenizer Selection for New Projects

Choosing a tokenizer is one of the earliest and most consequential decisions in any LLM project, yet it rarely receives proportional deliberation. The decision framework depends on whether you are pretraining from scratch, fine-tuning an existing model, or building an application on top of a model API.

### When to Reuse an Existing Tokenizer

For **fine-tuning** or **continued pretraining**, the answer is almost always to reuse the base model's tokenizer unchanged. Modifying the vocabulary invalidates the pretrained embedding weights and output projection — every added or removed token is effectively untrained. Even adding a handful of special tokens requires careful initialization and targeted training.

For **new pretraining runs**, reusing a well-established tokenizer (e.g., Llama's SentencePiece vocabulary, or GPT-4's tiktoken cl100k_base) is a reasonable default. These tokenizers were trained on large, diverse corpora and encode English and common programming languages efficiently. The engineering cost of training and validating a custom tokenizer is non-trivial, and the gains are often marginal for general-purpose models.

### When to Train a Custom Tokenizer

A custom tokenizer is justified when the domain distribution differs significantly from general web text:

- **Specialized languages**: if the primary use case involves languages underrepresented in standard tokenizers, a custom tokenizer trained on a balanced corpus will produce dramatically better token fertility. A model serving primarily Thai, Burmese, or Amharic users should not inherit an English-centric vocabulary.
- **Domain-specific notation**: medical terminology, chemical formulas (SMILES strings), mathematical notation, or legal citations may be heavily fragmented by general-purpose tokenizers. Training BPE on domain corpora ensures these common patterns become single tokens.
- **Code-heavy workloads**: if the model is primarily for code generation, the tokenizer should be trained on code to ensure that common language keywords, operators, and indentation patterns tokenize cleanly. StarCoder and CodeLlama both use code-optimized tokenizers for this reason.

### Vocabulary Size as an Architectural Parameter

Vocabulary size interacts with model size in ways that are often underappreciated. The embedding matrix contains $V \times d$ parameters, and the output projection (language model head) contains another $V \times d$ — together, these scale linearly with vocabulary size (see [Article 01: Transformer Architecture](./agent-01-transformer-architecture.md) for how embeddings fit into the overall parameter budget). For a 70B-parameter model, the difference between a 32K and 128K vocabulary at $d = 8192$ is roughly $2 \times 96000 \times 8192 \approx 1.6B$ parameters — a rounding error. For a 1B-parameter model, that same difference is over 10% of total parameters, and many of those embedding vectors will be undertrained.

The practical guidance follows from this math:

| Model Scale | Recommended Vocab Size | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| < 1B parameters | 16K-32K | Minimize embedding tax; every parameter matters |
| 1B-10B parameters | 32K-64K | Balance sequence length and embedding overhead |
| 10B+ parameters | 64K-128K+ | Embedding cost is negligible; shorter sequences reduce serving cost |

Larger vocabularies also improve inference throughput by reducing sequence length — fewer tokens means fewer forward passes in autoregressive generation. For serving-cost-sensitive deployments, a larger vocabulary can pay for itself even if some tokens are rarely used (see [Article 04: Model Architectures](./agent-04-model-architectures.md) for how vocabulary choices interact with architecture-level decisions like MoE routing and multi-token prediction).

### Evaluating Tokenizer Quality

Before committing to a tokenizer, evaluate it empirically on representative data from your target domain:

- **Fertility** (tokens per word or tokens per character) across all target languages and domains. Lower is better, but consistency across languages matters more than the absolute number.
- **Roundtrip fidelity**: verify that encode-then-decode is lossless for all expected inputs, including unicode edge cases, code with unusual indentation, and mixed-language text.
- **Token boundary quality**: inspect whether token boundaries fall at linguistically or structurally meaningful points. Tokens that split words mid-morpheme or split numbers at inconsistent positions signal problems.
- **Embedding utilization**: after training, check what fraction of the vocabulary is actually used at reasonable frequency. A vocabulary where 30% of tokens appear fewer than 100 times in the training corpus represents wasted parameters, and those rarely-seen tokens will have poorly trained embeddings (see [Article 13: Embedding Models](./agent-13-embedding-models.md) for how embedding quality impacts downstream retrieval and similarity tasks).

## Summary and Key Takeaways

- **BPE** (Sennrich et al., 2016) remains the dominant tokenization algorithm, operating either on characters (original) or bytes (tiktoken). Its frequency-based merging produces vocabularies well-adapted to the training data distribution.
- **SentencePiece** (Kudo and Richardson, 2018) provides language-agnostic tokenization by treating whitespace as part of the vocabulary, with byte fallback for complete unicode coverage.
- **Vocabulary size** is a significant architectural parameter: larger vocabularies shorten sequences but increase the embedding parameter tax. Most modern LLMs use 32K-100K+ tokens.
- **Multilingual tokenization** remains a major challenge, with non-English languages suffering 2-10x token fertility penalties due to English-dominated tokenizer training data.
- **Number and code tokenization** have outsized impact on model capabilities in those domains. Tokenizer design choices directly affect what tasks a model can learn well.
- **Pre-tokenization** (regex-based splitting before BPE) is critical for producing linguistically sensible tokens and is a key differentiator between tokenizer implementations.
- **Tokenization-free** approaches (byte-level, character-level) are an active research area but remain impractical at scale due to sequence length costs.
- When choosing or designing a tokenizer, consider the full cost: embedding parameters, sequence length, multilingual coverage, and domain-specific needs (code, math, structured data).
