# Distillation & Model Compression: Pruning, Quantization & Student Models

Deploying large language models in production requires navigating the tension between model quality and computational cost, a tension that model compression techniques directly address. This article provides a technical deep-dive into knowledge distillation, structured and unstructured pruning, post-training quantization versus quantization-aware training, the GPTQ and AWQ algorithms, and emerging model merging techniques like TIES, DARE, and SLERP. These methods are not theoretical curiosities; they are the practical tools that determine whether a model runs on a single GPU, on a mobile device, or at all within a given latency budget. Understanding their trade-offs is essential for any engineer deploying LLMs at scale.

## Knowledge Distillation

### The Hinton Framework

Knowledge distillation, introduced by Hinton, Vinyals, and Dean (2015) in "Distilling the Knowledge in a Neural Network," transfers knowledge from a large "teacher" model to a smaller "student" model. The key insight is that the teacher's soft probability distribution over outputs contains far more information than the hard labels alone.

Consider a classification example: a teacher model might assign probabilities [0.7, 0.2, 0.05, 0.05] to four classes. The hard label only says "class 1," but the soft distribution reveals that class 2 is somewhat plausible, and classes 3 and 4 are equally unlikely. These "dark knowledge" relationships between classes encode rich structural information about the problem.

The distillation loss uses a temperature-scaled softmax:

$$\mathcal{L}_{distill} = T^2 \cdot D_{KL}\left(\sigma\left(\frac{z_s}{T}\right) \| \sigma\left(\frac{z_t}{T}\right)\right)$$

where $z_s$ and $z_t$ are student and teacher logits, $T$ is the temperature (typically 2-20), and $\sigma$ is the softmax function. Higher temperatures produce softer distributions that reveal more inter-class relationships.

The total student loss combines distillation with the standard task loss:

$$\mathcal{L}_{student} = \alpha \cdot \mathcal{L}_{distill} + (1 - \alpha) \cdot \mathcal{L}_{task}$$

where $\alpha$ balances the two objectives. Typical values are $\alpha \in [0.5, 0.9]$.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F

def distillation_loss(student_logits, teacher_logits, labels,
                      temperature=4.0, alpha=0.7):
    """Combined distillation and task loss."""
    # Soft targets from teacher
    soft_loss = F.kl_div(
        F.log_softmax(student_logits / temperature, dim=-1),
        F.softmax(teacher_logits / temperature, dim=-1),
        reduction='batchmean'
    ) * (temperature ** 2)

    # Hard targets (standard cross-entropy)
    hard_loss = F.cross_entropy(student_logits, labels)

    return alpha * soft_loss + (1 - alpha) * hard_loss
```

### Distillation for Language Models

For autoregressive language models, distillation operates on the per-token probability distribution. The student is trained to match the teacher's next-token distribution at each position:

```python
def lm_distillation_loss(student_model, teacher_model, input_ids,
                         attention_mask, temperature=2.0, alpha=0.5):
    """Distillation loss for causal language models."""
    # Get student logits
    student_outputs = student_model(
        input_ids=input_ids, attention_mask=attention_mask
    )
    student_logits = student_outputs.logits[:, :-1, :]  # Shift for next-token

    # Get teacher logits (no gradient needed)
    with torch.no_grad():
        teacher_outputs = teacher_model(
            input_ids=input_ids, attention_mask=attention_mask
        )
        teacher_logits = teacher_outputs.logits[:, :-1, :]

    # Labels are the next tokens
    labels = input_ids[:, 1:]

    # Per-token distillation loss
    vocab_size = student_logits.size(-1)
    soft_loss = F.kl_div(
        F.log_softmax(student_logits.view(-1, vocab_size) / temperature, dim=-1),
        F.softmax(teacher_logits.view(-1, vocab_size) / temperature, dim=-1),
        reduction='batchmean'
    ) * (temperature ** 2)

    # Standard language modeling loss
    hard_loss = F.cross_entropy(
        student_logits.view(-1, vocab_size), labels.view(-1)
    )

    return alpha * soft_loss + (1 - alpha) * hard_loss
```

### Student Architecture Design

The student model architecture significantly impacts distillation quality:

- **Depth reduction**: Remove transformer layers. A 12-layer student from a 24-layer teacher retains more knowledge than reducing hidden dimensions.
- **Width reduction**: Reduce hidden dimensions and number of attention heads. This gives uniform compression across all layers.
- **Hybrid**: Reduce both, but prioritize depth over width for the same parameter budget.

Research by Jiao et al. (2020, "TinyBERT") and Sanh et al. (2019, "DistilBERT") established that a student with roughly half the layers of the teacher can retain 95-97% of performance while being 2x faster at inference.

### Layer Mapping Strategies

When the student has fewer layers than the teacher, you need to decide which teacher layers to align with which student layers:

- **Uniform**: Map every $k$-th teacher layer to the student (e.g., teacher layers 0, 4, 8, 12 map to student layers 0, 1, 2, 3)
- **Top-heavy**: Align more student layers with the teacher's later layers, which tend to be more task-specific
- **Learned**: Use attention-based mapping that learns which teacher layers are most informative for each student layer

```python
def uniform_layer_mapping(n_teacher_layers, n_student_layers):
    """Map student layers to uniformly spaced teacher layers."""
    step = n_teacher_layers // n_student_layers
    return {i: i * step for i in range(n_student_layers)}

# For a 24-layer teacher and 6-layer student:
# {0: 0, 1: 4, 2: 8, 3: 12, 4: 16, 5: 20}
```

## Pruning

Pruning removes redundant parameters or structures from a trained model, reducing size and computation. Two major categories exist:

### Unstructured Pruning

Unstructured pruning removes individual weights (setting them to zero) based on magnitude or other importance criteria:

```python
import torch.nn.utils.prune as prune

def magnitude_prune(model, sparsity=0.5):
    """Apply unstructured magnitude pruning to all linear layers."""
    for name, module in model.named_modules():
        if isinstance(module, torch.nn.Linear):
            prune.l1_unstructured(module, name='weight', amount=sparsity)
            # Make pruning permanent
            prune.remove(module, 'weight')

    # Count zeros
    total = sum(p.numel() for p in model.parameters())
    zeros = sum((p == 0).sum().item() for p in model.parameters())
    print(f"Sparsity: {zeros/total*100:.1f}%")
```

Unstructured pruning can achieve high sparsity (90%+) with minimal accuracy loss, but has a critical limitation: modern hardware (GPUs, TPUs) is not optimized for sparse computation. The pruned weights are still stored and processed; they are just zero. Achieving actual speedup requires specialized sparse kernels or hardware.

### Structured Pruning

Structured pruning removes entire structures: attention heads, neurons in feed-forward layers, or entire transformer layers. This produces dense models that benefit from standard hardware acceleration:

```python
def prune_attention_heads(model, heads_to_prune):
    """Remove entire attention heads from a transformer model.

    heads_to_prune: dict of {layer_idx: [head_indices]}
    """
    for layer_idx, heads in heads_to_prune.items():
        layer = model.encoder.layer[layer_idx]
        # Remove heads by zeroing their weight matrices
        # and adjusting the output projection
        prune_heads(layer.attention, heads)

def identify_unimportant_heads(model, eval_dataloader):
    """Identify attention heads with lowest importance scores."""
    head_importance = compute_head_importance(model, eval_dataloader)
    # head_importance: [num_layers, num_heads]

    # Sort heads by importance
    all_heads = []
    for layer in range(head_importance.size(0)):
        for head in range(head_importance.size(1)):
            all_heads.append((layer, head, head_importance[layer, head].item()))

    all_heads.sort(key=lambda x: x[2])  # Sort by importance
    return all_heads
```

Michel et al. (2019) in "Are Sixteen Heads Really Better than One?" showed that many attention heads can be removed with minimal quality loss, suggesting significant redundancy in transformer architectures.

### SparseGPT

Frantar and Alistarh (2023) introduced SparseGPT, which achieves 50-60% unstructured sparsity on large language models in a single pass (no retraining required). SparseGPT uses an approximate second-order method to solve the layer-wise pruning problem optimally, considering the correlation structure between weights rather than pruning by magnitude alone.

```python
# Using SparseGPT via the sparseml library
from sparseml.transformers import SparseAutoModelForCausalLM

model = SparseAutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    "meta-llama/Llama-3-8B",
    recipe="recipe.yaml"  # Specifies sparsity targets
)

# recipe.yaml specifies:
# - 50% unstructured sparsity
# - Calibration dataset for optimal pruning
# - Optional quantization (2:4 sparsity + INT8)
```

## Quantization

Quantization reduces the numerical precision of model weights and/or activations, trading precision for reduced memory and faster computation.

### Precision Formats

| Format | Bits | Range | Use Case |
|--------|------|-------|----------|
| FP32 | 32 | Full | Training (legacy) |
| BF16 | 16 | Wide range, low precision | Training & inference |
| FP16 | 16 | Narrower range, higher precision | Mixed precision training |
| INT8 | 8 | [-128, 127] | Inference quantization |
| INT4 | 4 | [-8, 7] | Aggressive inference quantization |
| NF4 | 4 | Normal distribution optimized | QLoRA training |

### Post-Training Quantization (PTQ)

PTQ quantizes a trained model without further training. The simplest form is round-to-nearest (RTN):

$$W_q = \text{round}\left(\frac{W}{s}\right) \cdot s, \quad s = \frac{\max(|W|)}{2^{b-1} - 1}$$

where $s$ is the scaling factor and $b$ is the target bit-width.

RTN works well for INT8 but degrades significantly at INT4 for large models. More sophisticated PTQ methods use calibration data to minimize the quantization error:

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM
import torch

def simple_ptq_int8(model):
    """Naive per-tensor INT8 quantization."""
    quantized_state = {}
    for name, param in model.named_parameters():
        if param.dim() >= 2:  # Only quantize weight matrices
            scale = param.abs().max() / 127.0
            quantized = torch.round(param / scale).clamp(-128, 127).to(torch.int8)
            quantized_state[name] = {
                'quantized_weight': quantized,
                'scale': scale
            }
        else:
            quantized_state[name] = {'weight': param}
    return quantized_state
```

### GPTQ: Accurate Post-Training Quantization

Frantar et al. (2023) developed GPTQ, which quantizes large language models to 3-4 bits with minimal quality loss. GPTQ uses the Optimal Brain Quantization (OBQ) framework, quantizing weights one at a time and adjusting the remaining weights to compensate for quantization error.

The algorithm works layer by layer:
1. Compute the Hessian matrix $H = 2X^TX$ from calibration data (where $X$ is the layer input)
2. For each weight column, find the quantized value that minimizes the output error
3. Update remaining (unquantized) weights to compensate: $\delta_F = -\frac{w_q - w}{[H^{-1}]_{qq}} \cdot (H^{-1})_{:,q}$
4. This "error compensation" is what allows GPTQ to achieve much better quality than naive rounding

```python
from auto_gptq import AutoGPTQForCausalLM, BaseQuantizeConfig

# Configure GPTQ quantization
quantize_config = BaseQuantizeConfig(
    bits=4,
    group_size=128,        # Quantize in groups for better accuracy
    desc_act=True,         # Use activation-aware ordering
    damp_percent=0.01,     # Dampening for Hessian stability
)

# Load model and quantize
model = AutoGPTQForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    "meta-llama/Llama-3-8B",
    quantize_config=quantize_config,
)

# Quantize using calibration data
model.quantize(calibration_dataset)

# Save quantized model (~4GB instead of ~16GB)
model.save_quantized("Llama-3-8B-GPTQ")
```

### AWQ: Activation-Aware Weight Quantization

Lin et al. (2023) proposed AWQ, which observes that not all weights are equally important for model output. Weights connected to larger activation magnitudes are more important and should be quantized more carefully.

AWQ's key innovation is **per-channel scaling**: before quantization, multiply weights by a scaling factor $s$ that protects important channels:

$$Q(W \cdot \text{diag}(s)) \cdot \text{diag}(s)^{-1} \cdot X$$

The scaling factor $s$ is optimized to minimize quantization error on calibration data, effectively allocating more of the limited quantization precision to channels that matter most.

AWQ advantages over GPTQ:
- **Faster quantization**: No iterative weight updates required
- **Better generalization**: Does not overfit to calibration data
- **Hardware friendly**: The scaling can be fused into adjacent operations

```python
from awq import AutoAWQForCausalLM

model = AutoAWQForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    "meta-llama/Llama-3-8B", device_map="auto"
)

quant_config = {
    "zero_point": True,
    "q_group_size": 128,
    "w_bit": 4,
    "version": "GEMM"  # or "GEMV" for batch_size=1
}

model.quantize(
    tokenizer,
    quant_config=quant_config,
    calib_data=calibration_samples
)

model.save_quantized("Llama-3-8B-AWQ")
```

### Quantization-Aware Training (QAT)

QAT simulates quantization during training, allowing the model to adapt to quantization noise. It consistently outperforms PTQ but requires a training run:

```python
def quantize_aware_forward(weight, bits=8):
    """Simulate quantization during forward pass with straight-through estimator."""
    scale = weight.abs().max() / (2 ** (bits - 1) - 1)
    # Forward: quantize
    weight_q = torch.round(weight / scale) * scale
    # Backward: straight-through (gradient passes through as if no quantization)
    weight_q = weight + (weight_q - weight).detach()
    return weight_q
```

QAT is more computationally expensive than PTQ but produces better results, especially at very low bit-widths (2-3 bits). For most practical purposes, GPTQ and AWQ at 4 bits provide sufficient quality without the training overhead.

## Model Merging

Model merging combines multiple fine-tuned models into a single model without additional training. This enables combining specialized capabilities from different fine-tunes.

### Linear Merging (Model Soup)

The simplest approach averages model weights:

$$\theta_{merged} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \theta_i$$

Or with weighted averaging:

$$\theta_{merged} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i \theta_i, \quad \sum w_i = 1$$

Wortsman et al. (2022) showed in "Model Soups" that averaging multiple fine-tunes of the same base model often outperforms any individual model, without any additional training.

### TIES: Trimming, Electing Signs, and Merging

Yadav et al. (2023) identified that naive merging suffers from two problems: (1) redundant parameters that changed minimally during fine-tuning add noise, and (2) sign conflicts between models (one model increased a weight, another decreased it) cause destructive interference.

TIES addresses both:

```python
def ties_merge(models, base_model, density=0.2):
    """TIES merging: Trim, Elect signs, then merge."""
    base_params = dict(base_model.named_parameters())
    task_vectors = []

    # Step 1: Compute task vectors (delta from base)
    for model in models:
        tv = {}
        for name, param in model.named_parameters():
            tv[name] = param.data - base_params[name].data
        task_vectors.append(tv)

    merged = {}
    for name in base_params:
        deltas = torch.stack([tv[name] for tv in task_vectors])

        # Step 2: TRIM - zero out small-magnitude changes
        threshold = torch.quantile(deltas.abs().flatten(), 1 - density)
        trimmed = deltas.clone()
        trimmed[trimmed.abs() < threshold] = 0

        # Step 3: ELECT SIGN - resolve sign conflicts by majority vote
        sign_sum = trimmed.sign().sum(dim=0)
        elected_sign = sign_sum.sign()

        # Zero out values that disagree with elected sign
        for i in range(len(models)):
            mask = trimmed[i].sign() != elected_sign
            trimmed[i][mask] = 0

        # Step 4: MERGE - average the trimmed, sign-aligned deltas
        merged_delta = trimmed.mean(dim=0)
        merged[name] = base_params[name].data + merged_delta

    return merged
```

### DARE: Drop and Rescale

Yu et al. (2024) proposed DARE, which randomly drops a large fraction (90-99%) of delta parameters and rescales the remaining ones:

$$\tilde{\delta}_t = \frac{m_t \odot \delta_t}{1 - p}$$

where $m_t$ is a random binary mask with drop rate $p$, $\delta_t$ is the task vector, and the rescaling by $1/(1-p)$ preserves the expected magnitude.

DARE works because fine-tuning typically produces highly redundant updates, and random subsets of these updates capture the essential adaptation. DARE is often combined with TIES for best results.

### SLERP: Spherical Linear Interpolation

SLERP interpolates between two models along a geodesic on the hypersphere, rather than linear interpolation in weight space:

$$\theta_{merged} = \frac{\sin((1-t)\Omega)}{\sin(\Omega)} \theta_1 + \frac{\sin(t\Omega)}{\sin(\Omega)} \theta_2$$

where $\Omega = \arccos\left(\frac{\theta_1 \cdot \theta_2}{|\theta_1||\theta_2|}\right)$ is the angle between the two parameter vectors, and $t \in [0, 1]$ controls the interpolation.

SLERP is limited to merging exactly two models but often produces smoother interpolations than linear averaging, especially when the models have diverged significantly from each other.

### Practical Merging with mergekit

The mergekit library provides a unified interface for model merging:

```yaml
# mergekit config for TIES merge
merge_method: ties
base_model: meta-llama/Llama-3-8B
models:
  - model: coding-specialist/Llama-3-8B-Code
    parameters:
      weight: 0.5
      density: 0.5
  - model: math-specialist/Llama-3-8B-Math
    parameters:
      weight: 0.3
      density: 0.5
  - model: writing-specialist/Llama-3-8B-Creative
    parameters:
      weight: 0.2
      density: 0.5
parameters:
  normalize: true
dtype: bfloat16
```

```bash
mergekit-yaml merge_config.yaml ./merged-model --cuda
```

## Compression Pipeline

In practice, these techniques are often combined in sequence:

1. **Distillation**: Train a smaller student model from a large teacher
2. **Pruning**: Remove redundant structures from the student
3. **Quantization**: Reduce precision of the pruned model
4. **Optionally merge**: Combine with other specialized models

```python
class CompressionPipeline:
    def __init__(self, teacher_model, student_config):
        self.teacher = teacher_model
        self.student_config = student_config

    def run(self, train_data, calibration_data):
        # Stage 1: Distillation
        print("Stage 1: Knowledge distillation...")
        student = self.distill(train_data, epochs=5, temperature=4.0)

        # Stage 2: Structured pruning
        print("Stage 2: Pruning attention heads...")
        unimportant_heads = identify_unimportant_heads(student, calibration_data)
        heads_to_prune = select_heads(unimportant_heads, prune_ratio=0.25)
        prune_attention_heads(student, heads_to_prune)

        # Stage 3: Fine-tune after pruning (recover quality)
        print("Stage 3: Recovery fine-tuning...")
        student = self.recovery_finetune(student, train_data, epochs=2)

        # Stage 4: Quantization
        print("Stage 4: GPTQ quantization to 4-bit...")
        quantized = self.quantize_gptq(student, calibration_data)

        return quantized
```

### Quality-Size Trade-offs

Typical quality retention at different compression levels (relative to full-precision base model):

| Compression Method | Size Reduction | Quality Retention |
|-------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| FP16 (from FP32) | 2x | ~100% |
| INT8 PTQ | 4x | 99%+ |
| GPTQ 4-bit | 8x | 96-99% |
| AWQ 4-bit | 8x | 97-99% |
| Distillation (2x smaller) | 2x | 95-97% |
| Pruning 50% + INT8 | 8x | 93-96% |
| Distillation + GPTQ 4-bit | 16x | 90-95% |

## Summary and Key Takeaways

- **Knowledge distillation** transfers the "dark knowledge" in a teacher's soft probability distributions to a smaller student model. Temperature scaling reveals inter-class relationships. Students with half the teacher's layers can retain 95-97% of performance.
- **Unstructured pruning** zeros individual weights and can achieve 50-90% sparsity, but requires sparse hardware/kernels for actual speedup. SparseGPT achieves this in a single pass.
- **Structured pruning** removes entire attention heads, neurons, or layers, producing dense models with real speedups on standard hardware.
- **GPTQ** uses second-order information to quantize models to 4 bits with minimal quality loss, compensating for each weight's quantization error in the remaining weights.
- **AWQ** protects important weight channels (identified via activation magnitudes) during quantization, achieving comparable quality to GPTQ with faster quantization and better generalization.
- **QAT** integrates quantization into training for better quality at very low bit-widths but requires a full training run.
- **Model merging** (TIES, DARE, SLERP) combines specialized fine-tunes without additional training. TIES resolves sign conflicts; DARE randomly prunes redundant updates; SLERP interpolates on the hypersphere.
- The practical compression pipeline is: **distill (if architecture change needed) -> prune (structural redundancy) -> quantize (precision reduction) -> merge (combine specializations)**. Each step compounds the compression with diminishing quality costs.
- For most deployment scenarios, **AWQ or GPTQ at 4 bits** is the sweet spot, offering 4x memory reduction with negligible quality loss on modern LLMs.
