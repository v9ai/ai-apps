I asked an AI coding assistant to implement a page layout from a Figma design. It got the heading size wrong (28px instead of 24px), inserted a 4px gap where there should have been 8px, and hallucinated a duplicate magnifying glass icon inside the search bar. The overall structure was fine. The details were not.

This is the state of AI-assisted design-to-code in 2026. The tools get you 65-80% of the way there, then leave you in a no-man's land where the remaining pixels matter more than all the ones that came before. Every frontend engineer who has shipped production UI knows: "close enough" is not close enough.

I spent a session trying to close that gap using the toolchain everyone is talking about -- Figma MCP for design context, headless Playwright for runtime measurement, and an AI assistant for the correction loop. Here is what happened, what broke, and what produced results.

## The Promise: AI-Powered Design-to-Code

The pitch is compelling. [Figma's MCP server](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/32132100833559-Guide-to-the-Figma-MCP-server) gives AI coding assistants semantic access to your designs -- not screenshots, but structured data about components, spacing tokens, and layout constraints. Playwright MCP lets the AI control a browser to verify its own work. Wire them together and the assistant can read a design, generate code, measure the result, and self-correct.

[MCP reached 97 million monthly SDK downloads and 10,000+ active servers by the end of 2025](https://www.pento.ai/blog/a-year-of-mcp-2025-review), before Anthropic donated it to the Linux Foundation's Agentic AI Foundation. The protocol is real. The ecosystem is real. The promise of closing the design-to-code fidelity gap is the headline use case.

And yet, [a controlled comparison study](https://dev.to/oikon/can-ai-tools-implement-designs-perfectly-h36) testing multiple AI tools on the same Figma template found fidelity scores ranging from 65% to 80%. Kombai hit the top at 75-80%. Claude Code landed at 65-70%. These numbers match what I measured: the broad strokes are right, the pixels are wrong.

Meanwhile, [46% of developers distrust AI tool output accuracy, versus only 33% who trust it](https://www.secondtalent.com/resources/ai-generated-code-quality-metrics-and-statistics-for-2026/). That distrust is earned. The question is not whether AI can generate UI code -- it can. The question is whether you can verify and correct it efficiently enough to ship production quality.

## The Setup: Figma MCP, Playwright, and Radix Themes

My stack: Next.js with Radix Themes v3, TypeScript, headless Playwright for measurement, and the Figma REST API for design context. The target was a job board landing page -- a heading, subtext, a search bar with filter chips. Simple enough that spacing errors are immediately visible.

The intended setup was three MCP servers working together:

1. **Figma MCP** -- reads design files, extracts component structure, spacing tokens, and typography specs
2. **Playwright MCP** -- controls a headless browser, takes screenshots, measures rendered elements
3. **AI assistant** -- orchestrates the loop: read design, generate code, measure, correct

Here is where the plan met reality.

### Figma MCP: configured but not loadable

I had the Figma MCP server configured as a stdio transport in the project's settings. The configuration was correct. The server was installed. But when the session started, it did not surface as a loadable deferred tool. The tool search returned nothing.

This is not a bug in the protocol. MCP stdio servers need to be spawned and their capabilities discovered at connection time. But the tooling UX around this -- which servers are available, why one failed to load, what capabilities it exposes -- is still rough. The protocol is standardized. The developer experience around it is not.

The fallback was straightforward: hit the [Figma REST API](https://www.figma.com/developers/api) directly with curl and an `X-Figma-Token` header. This gave me the same design data -- node measurements, component properties, spacing values -- without the MCP abstraction. Less elegant, entirely functional.

Worth noting: [Figma's MCP rate limits](https://developers.figma.com/docs/figma-mcp-server/plans-access-and-permissions/) are aggressive. Starter plans get six calls per month. Organization gets 200 per day. Enterprise gets 600. If you are iterating on pixel-perfect corrections, you will burn through those allocations fast. The REST API with a personal access token has more generous limits for development.

### Playwright MCP: context loss after resize

The Playwright MCP integration had its own surprise. After navigating to the dev server and resizing the viewport to match the design dimensions, the browser navigated itself to `about:blank`. The page context was gone. Every measurement script returned nothing because there was nothing to measure.

The fix was to re-navigate after the resize. But this is the kind of silent failure that burns time if you are not watching carefully. The AI assistant did not flag it. The MCP tool reported success. Only the empty measurement results revealed that something had gone wrong.

### The language assumption

One more friction point: the AI assistant defaulted to Python for Playwright scripts. The project is TypeScript. The Playwright documentation covers both, but the assistant's default was wrong for this context. I had to redirect it to TypeScript explicitly. Minor on its own, but this is the kind of assumption that compounds when you are building a measurement pipeline in a TypeScript project.

## Measuring Pixel Perfection: Headless Playwright as a Design Gate

With the setup issues sorted, here is the core insight that made this workflow productive: **use Playwright not for visual regression testing, but as a measurement instrument.**

Playwright's built-in `toHaveScreenshot()` compares screenshots against a baseline. That catches regressions -- did the UI change from what it looked like last week? But it does not tell you if the baseline matches the design. The gap is design-to-code, not code-to-code.

What works instead is running Playwright headlessly and using `page.evaluate()` to extract computed styles and bounding box dimensions from rendered elements. You get numbers -- actual pixel values -- that you can compare against the Figma spec.

```typescript
const measurements = await page.evaluate(() => {
  const heading = document.querySelector('h1');
  const subtext = document.querySelector('[data-subtext]');
  const searchBar = document.querySelector('[data-search]');

  if (!heading || !subtext || !searchBar) {
    return { error: 'Elements not found' };
  }

  const hRect = heading.getBoundingClientRect();
  const sRect = subtext.getBoundingClientRect();
  const bRect = searchBar.getBoundingClientRect();

  return {
    headingFontSize: getComputedStyle(heading).fontSize,
    headingTop: hRect.top,
    headingToSubtext: sRect.top - hRect.bottom,
    subtextToSearch: bRect.top - sRect.bottom,
    searchBarHeight: bRect.height,
  };
});
```

This is a plain JavaScript string passed to `page.evaluate()`. That detail matters.

### The tsx name mangling trap

If you write the measurement function as a TypeScript arrow function and pass it to `page.evaluate()`, tsx (the TypeScript execution engine) transforms your code and injects a `__name` helper that does not exist in the browser context. The result: `ReferenceError: __name is not defined`. Your measurement script crashes with an error that has nothing to do with your code.

This is a [known issue since tsx 4.15.0](https://github.com/privatenumber/tsx/issues/113), also [tracked in the Playwright repo](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/31569). It affects `page.evaluate()`, `addInitScript()`, and any code that crosses the Node-to-browser boundary through tsx.

The fix: pass a plain JavaScript string to `page.evaluate()` instead of a function reference. Or run your measurement scripts with `npx playwright test` directly rather than through tsx. Either way, you need to know this pitfall exists before you spend an hour debugging a `ReferenceError` that should not be possible.

One more operational detail: `@playwright/test` must be run from the project directory. If your script runs from `/tmp` or another temporary location, module resolution fails. This bit me when the AI assistant tried to create a standalone measurement script outside the project root.

## The Measurement-Driven Loop: Real Corrections

With headless Playwright producing actual numbers, the correction loop became mechanical rather than subjective. Here is what the measurements revealed and what changed.

### Radix Themes spacing is not what you think

Radix Themes v3 uses a spacing scale where the token names do not map to pixel values the way you might guess. Measurement revealed:

- `space-6` renders at **40px**, not 24px
- `Heading size="6"` renders at **24px** font size
- `Heading size="7"` renders at **28px** font size

If you are eyeballing these or letting an AI guess from the token name, you will be wrong. The AI generated a heading at `size="7"` (28px) when the design specified 24px. Only measurement caught this -- the visual difference between 24px and 28px in a heading is subtle enough to pass a casual review but obvious enough to bother a designer.

### The corrections

Each fix was driven by a specific measurement delta, not by visual impression:

| Element | Before | After | Delta | How found |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Heading size | 28px (size="7") | 24px (size="6") | -4px | `getComputedStyle().fontSize` |
| H1 to subtext gap | 4px | 8px | +4px | `boundingRect` difference |
| Duplicate search icon | Present | Removed | -- | DOM query found two magnifying glass SVGs |
| Container padding | `px="4"` | Removed | Reduced horizontal inset | Measured vs Figma frame width |

The final vertical rhythm: top padding = 40px, heading = 24px, gap to subtext = 8px, subtext to search = 16px, search to chips = 8px. Every value verified by Playwright against the Figma spec.

### The duplicate icon

The most interesting bug was the duplicate magnifying glass icon. The AI had placed a search icon in the search bar's left slot (correct) but also inserted one in the right slot (incorrect -- the right slot should have been empty or contained a submit button). This was not a spacing issue. It was a hallucination -- the AI generated a plausible but wrong component structure.

Playwright caught it because I was querying all SVG elements inside the search bar container:

```typescript
const iconCount = await page.evaluate(() => {
  const searchBar = document.querySelector('[data-search]');
  return searchBar
    ? searchBar.querySelectorAll('svg').length
    : 0;
});
// Expected: 1, Got: 2
```

No amount of visual regression testing would have caught this against its own baseline. The baseline would have included the duplicate. Only comparing against the design spec -- which specified one icon -- revealed the error.

## Where Figma MCP Breaks Down

Even when Figma MCP loads correctly and you have the rate limit headroom, several gaps remain between what the protocol provides and what pixel-perfect implementation requires.

### Spatial reasoning is still hard for LLMs

MCP gives the AI structural information: this component has these children, this frame uses auto-layout with a 16px gap, this text uses the heading/large style. What it does not convey well is the *why* behind spacing decisions. Why is the gap between the heading and subtext 8px but the gap between subtext and the search bar 16px? The design system has a rationale. The MCP payload has numbers.

LLMs can read the numbers. They struggle with the spatial reasoning needed to maintain them consistently, especially when generating responsive layouts where the same design intent requires different pixel values at different breakpoints.

### Token walls and context loss

Complex Figma files generate large node trees. [MCP responses can hit token limits](https://developers.figma.com/docs/figma-mcp-server/plans-access-and-permissions/) that force truncation, which means the AI loses context on deeply nested components. You end up making multiple targeted requests for specific nodes rather than fetching the whole page -- possible, but it means you need to know which nodes to ask about. That somewhat defeats the automation story.

### CSS variable mapping gaps

Figma design tokens and CSS custom properties are not a 1:1 mapping. Radix Themes uses a `--space-*` scale and `--font-size-*` tokens that roughly correspond to Figma variables, but "roughly" is doing real work in that sentence. The `space-6` = 40px example is illustrative: the token names follow a convention that does not match naive numeric assumptions, and the Figma representation may use absolute pixel values while the code uses tokens that resolve differently depending on the theme configuration.

## MCP Protocol Friction: The Honest Assessment

Setting aside Figma-specific issues, the MCP protocol itself introduces friction that matters for this workflow.

**Session-less architecture.** MCP is stateless. Each tool call is independent. The AI assistant cannot say "remember the design context from two calls ago" -- it needs to re-fetch or the context lives in the assistant's own window, consuming tokens. For an iterative measurement-correction loop, this means repeating context that should be cached.

**No capability discovery at scale.** With 10,000+ MCP servers in the ecosystem, finding the right one and verifying it works with your client is still manual. My Figma MCP stdio server was correctly configured and did not load. There was no diagnostic path beyond "try the REST API instead."

**Latency.** Each MCP call involves spawning a process (for stdio transport), making the API request, and returning structured data. For rapid iteration -- measure, correct, re-measure -- this latency compounds. The REST API with a direct HTTP call was faster for my use case.

None of these are fatal. MCP is a young protocol solving a real problem. But if you are evaluating it for a pixel-perfect workflow that requires tight iteration loops, the ergonomics are not there yet.

## What Actually Produces Pixel-Perfect Results

After a session of fighting with MCP configuration, working around tsx bugs, and re-navigating lost browser contexts, here is the workflow that produced pixel-perfect output.

### The three-step loop

1. **Read the design spec** -- either via Figma MCP (if it loads) or the REST API. Extract the specific values: font sizes in pixels, spacing between elements in pixels, exact component structure.

2. **Measure the rendered output** -- run a headless Playwright script that extracts `getComputedStyle()` values and `getBoundingClientRect()` positions for the elements you care about. Compare against the spec. Produce a diff.

3. **Correct with precision** -- feed the measurement diff to the AI assistant. Not "this looks wrong" but "heading font size is 28px, spec says 24px, change Heading size from 7 to 6." Specific, numerical, unambiguous.

This loop is mechanical. It removes aesthetic judgment from the correction process. The numbers say what is wrong. The fix is deterministic.

### When to use this workflow

**Use it for:** design system compliance, landing pages, marketing surfaces, any UI where a designer will review the output against a spec. These are cases where "close" is not enough and the cost of pixel-level errors is real (brand perception, design team trust, user polish).

**Skip it for:** internal tools, admin dashboards, prototypes, any UI where functional correctness matters more than visual precision. The measurement overhead is not justified when the standard is "does it work" rather than "does it match."

### Minimum viable setup

You do not need MCP for this. The minimum setup is:

1. A Figma file with your design (or any spec with pixel values)
2. Playwright installed in your project (`pnpm add -D @playwright/test`)
3. A measurement script that extracts the values you care about
4. An AI assistant that can read the measurement output and make targeted corrections

MCP adds convenience when it works. The REST API is a reliable fallback. The measurement layer is the non-negotiable piece -- without it, you are guessing.

## The Verdict: Useful but Not Magic

[Teams using AI UI tools ship 40-60% faster](https://www.banani.co/blog/ai-design-to-code-tools), and I believe it. The 65-80% that AI handles correctly is real productivity. But [AI-generated code introduces 1.7x more issues than human-written code](https://www.secondtalent.com/resources/ai-generated-code-quality-metrics-and-statistics-for-2026/), and in UI work, those issues are spacing errors, wrong token values, and hallucinated component structures that look plausible on first glance.

The Figma MCP + Playwright measurement workflow works. It closes the gap between "AI-generated" and "pixel-perfect." But it works because of the measurement layer, not because of the AI layer. The AI is the labor. Playwright is the quality gate. Figma (whether through MCP or the REST API) is the source of truth.

If you take one thing from this piece: **measure, do not eyeball.** The tooling for automated measurement exists. The tooling for automated design-to-code is getting better. The bridge between them -- feeding measured deltas back into targeted corrections -- is where pixel-perfect happens.

The pixels are in the details. And right now, details still require a loop that only a developer can close.
