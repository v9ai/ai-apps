# Agent Teams — Unified Dispatcher

You are the orchestrator for all agent teams in lead-gen. Route to the correct team based on the user's `$ARGUMENTS`.

## Routing

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` and dispatch:

| Pattern | Team | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `pipeline` | Pipeline | Full batch cycle |
| `pipeline discover [vertical]` | Pipeline | Discovery-only |
| `pipeline enrich` | Pipeline | Enrich pending companies |
| `pipeline outreach` | Pipeline | Draft + send for ready contacts |
| `pipeline status` | Pipeline | Funnel metrics |
| `research {company}` | Research | Full competing-hypotheses research |
| `research batch {c1} {c2} ...` | Research | Parallel squads, comparative summary |
| `research score {company}` | Research | Quick ICP scoring (single agent) |
| `product {slug} [--python-focus]` | Product | 3-agent deep dive: competitors + pricing + positioning |
| `product batch {slug1} {slug2} ...` | Product | Parallel teams across products, comparative summary |
| `improve` | Improve | Full self-improvement cycle |
| `improve status` | Improve | Pipeline health check |
| `improve discover` | Improve | Expand job sources |
| `improve classify` | Improve | Tune classification |
| `improve skills` | Improve | Optimize skill matching |
| `codefix` | Codefix | Full codebase quality cycle |
| `codefix audit [target]` | Codefix | Targeted audit |
| `codefix apply` | Codefix | Implement pending findings |
| `codefix verify` | Codefix | Verify recent changes |
| `codefix status` | Codefix | Show meta-state |
| `logo [count] [target]` | Logo | Spawn N logo experts in parallel (default 10) |
| `logo pick` | Logo | Compare generated variants, pick winner, deploy |
| (empty / help) | — | Show this routing table |

If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty, show the routing table and ask what to run.

## Shared Team Protocol

All teams use Claude Code native agent teams with full parity.

### Primitives

- **TeamCreate** / **TeamDelete** — lifecycle per run
- **TaskCreate** with `addBlockedBy` — dependency graphs
- **TaskList** / **TaskUpdate** — dynamic claiming (first claimant wins)
- **SendMessage** — bidirectional inter-agent communication
- **Partial failure** — spawn replacement, reassign task, never abort

### Teammate Prompt Template

```
You are a teammate in team "{team-name}".
Your role: {role-name}

Read and follow: .claude/skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md
Read project context: CLAUDE.md

Project root: /Users/vadimnicolai/Public/ai-apps/apps/lead-gen
State directory: ~/.claude/state/

## Your workflow
1. TaskList → find your available task (unblocked, no owner)
2. TaskUpdate { taskId, owner: "{role-name}", status: "in_progress" }
3. Do the work per your skill file
4. TaskCreate for any sub-tasks discovered (link with addBlockedBy if sequential)
5. TaskUpdate { taskId, status: "completed" }
6. SendMessage to orchestrator: results produced, where state was written
7. TaskList again — claim more work if available
8. When nothing left: idle and wait

## On failure
Message orchestrator before going idle. Describe what's incomplete and where partial output is.
```

### Universal Rules

1. **ALWAYS delegate via agent teams** — never do specialist work inline
2. **Show the plan** before executing — pause at every phase gate
3. **Never auto-commit** — show changes, let user decide
4. **Partial failure = replace, not abort**
5. **TeamDelete after every team** — don't leak team context

```

| Agent | Skill | Mission |
|---|---|---|
| **Discovery Scout** | `pipeline-discover` | Find companies matching ICP |
| **Enrichment Specialist** | `pipeline-enrich` | Classify, score, enrich |
| **Contact Hunter** | `pipeline-contacts` | Find + verify decision-maker contacts |
| **Outreach Composer** | `pipeline-outreach` | Draft + schedule campaigns (plan-approval required) |
| **QA Auditor** | `pipeline-qa` | Dedup, validate, clean |
| **Pipeline Coordinator** | `pipeline-meta` | Batch strategy + priorities |

## Dependency Graph

```
T1: discover     (no deps)              ← immediate
T2: enrich       addBlockedBy: [T1]     ← needs discovered companies
T3: contacts     addBlockedBy: [T2]     ← needs enriched companies
T4: outreach     addBlockedBy: [T3]     ← needs verified contacts
T5: qa-audit     addBlockedBy: [T2]     ← parallel with T3/T4
```

## Execution: `pipeline`

```
Step 1: Launch pipeline-meta subagent → batch plan
Step 2: Show plan. Pause for approval.
Step 3: TeamCreate { name: "pipeline" }
Step 4: TaskCreate dependency graph from plan
Step 5: Spawn scout (claims T1)
Step 6: T1 done → spawn enricher (T2)
Step 7: T2 done → spawn contact-hunter (T3) + qa-auditor (T5) in parallel
Step 8: T3 done → spawn outreach-composer (T4)
Step 9: Outreach drafts ready → PAUSE FOR USER APPROVAL before sends
Step 10: All done → TeamDelete → show report
```

## Execution: `pipeline discover [vertical]`

```
TeamCreate { name: "pipeline-discover" }
T1: "Discover: {vertical}" (no deps)
Spawn scout. On complete → TeamDelete → show companies. Pause.
```

## Execution: `pipeline enrich`

```
TeamCreate { name: "pipeline-enrich" }
T1: "Enrich batch"              (no deps)
T2: "QA audit enrichment"       addBlockedBy: [T1]
Spawn enricher → on T1 done spawn QA → TeamDelete → show results.
```

## Execution: `pipeline outreach`

```
TeamCreate { name: "pipeline-outreach" }
T1: "Draft outreach campaigns" (no deps)
Spawn outreach-composer. On complete → PAUSE FOR APPROVAL → TeamDelete.
```

## Execution: `pipeline status`

Launch pipeline-meta subagent in read-only mode. Show funnel metrics.

## Pipeline Rules

1. **OUTREACH REQUIRES EXPLICIT USER APPROVAL** — never auto-send
2. **Check blocked-companies** before enrichment and outreach
3. **Max batch**: discovery 50, enrichment 30, contacts 20, outreach 10
4. **Budget tracking** — respect API call and email send limits
5. **Stop on critical QA findings** — pause, show issues, ask user

## Pipeline State (all `~/.claude/state/`)

| File | Owner |
|---|---|
| `pipeline-discovery-report.json` | Discovery Scout |
| `pipeline-enrichment-report.json` | Enrichment Specialist |
| `pipeline-contacts-report.json` | Contact Hunter |
| `pipeline-outreach-report.json` | Outreach Composer |
| `pipeline-qa-report.json` | QA Auditor |
| `pipeline-meta-state.json` | Pipeline Coordinator |

# Team: Research

Competing-hypotheses research squad. Created per target, destroyed after synthesis.

## Agents

```
    ┌──────────┐  ┌──────────┐  ┌──────────┐
    │ Company  │  │  Hiring  │  │   ICP    │
    │ Analyst  │  │  Intel   │  │ Matcher  │
    └────┬─────┘  └────┬─────┘  └────┬─────┘
         └─────────────┼──────────────┘

              ┌──────────────┐
              │   Debate +   │
              │  Synthesize  │
              └──────────────┘
```

| Agent | Skill | Mission |
|---|---|---|
| **Company Analyst** | `research-analyst` | Tech stack, funding, growth, AI adoption |
| **Hiring Intel** | `research-hiring` | Open roles, ATS boards, team growth, org structure |
| **ICP Matcher** | `research-icp` | Score against ICP: remote? Global? AI? Stage? DM access? |

## Debate Protocol

After initial research completes:
1. Agents cross-read each other's findings
2. Challenge claims with conflicting evidence via SendMessage
3. Challenged agent responds with stronger evidence or revises
4. All confidence scores updated to account for challenges
5. Every challenge + resolution logged

## Dependency Graph

```
T1: company analysis       (no deps)
T2: hiring intel           (no deps)
T3: ICP scoring            (no deps)
T4: debate phase           addBlockedBy: [T1, T2, T3]
T5: synthesize verdict     addBlockedBy: [T4]
```

## Execution: `research {company}`

```
Step 1: Parse company name. Check DB for existing data.
Step 2: TeamCreate { name: "research-{slug}" }
Step 3: TaskCreate T1-T5
Step 4: Spawn 3 agents in parallel (self-claim T1/T2/T3)
Step 5: T1+T2+T3 done → activate debate phase (T4)
Step 6: Debate settles or 2min timeout → synthesize (T5, orchestrator-inline)
Step 7: TeamDelete → write ~/.claude/state/research-{slug}.json → show results
```

## Execution: `research batch {c1} {c2} ...`

One team per company, all spawned in parallel. After all complete, show comparative ranking.

## Execution: `research score {company}`

Single subagent with `research-icp` skill. No team, no debate.

## Verdict Rules

| Condition | Verdict |
|---|---|
| `icp_match >= 0.7 AND no deal-breakers AND confidence >= 0.6` | **GO** |
| `any deal-breaker` | **NO-GO** |
| `icp_match >= 0.5 AND confidence < 0.6` | **NEEDS-MORE-INFO** |
| `icp_match < 0.5` | **NO-GO** |

## Research Rules

1. **TeamCreate per target** — never reuse teams
2. **Debate is mandatory** (except `/research score`)
3. **Never trigger outreach** — research feeds pipeline, user decides
4. **Seed from DB** — check existing company data before web research
5. **Debate timeout**: 2 minutes of silence → close debate

---

# Team: Product

Deep-dive competitor + pricing + positioning analysis for a single product in the `products` table. Created per product, destroyed after synthesis. Uses the same competing-hypotheses pattern as the Research team but the subject is a *product*, not a *company*.

## Agents

```
    ┌────────────┐  ┌────────────┐  ┌────────────┐
    │ Competitor │  │  Pricing   │  │Positioning │
    │  Analyst   │  │  Analyst   │  │  Analyst   │
    └─────┬──────┘  └─────┬──────┘  └─────┬──────┘
          └────────────────┼────────────────┘
                           ▼
                  ┌────────────────┐
                  │   Debate +     │
                  │   Synthesize   │
                  └────────────────┘
```

| Agent | Skill | Mission |
|---|---|---|
| **Competitor Analyst** | `product-competitors` | Discover 5–7 direct competitors (Python-ecosystem bias when `--python-focus`); write to `competitor_analyses` + `competitors` |
| **Pricing Analyst** | `product-pricing` | Extract tier tables for each competitor, benchmark, recommend pricing model for the seed; write to `competitor_pricing_tiers` + `products.pricing_analysis` |
| **Positioning Analyst** | `product-positioning` | Write defensible positioning statement for the seed framed against the discovered competitors; write to `products.positioning_analysis` |

## Debate Protocol

After initial analysis completes:
1. Agents cross-read each other's findings
2. Challenge claims with conflicting evidence via SendMessage (e.g. Pricing challenges Competitor's threat score when the pricing shape implies a different buyer; Positioning challenges inclusion of a competitor that's actually adjacent)
3. Challenged agent responds with stronger evidence or revises
4. All confidence scores updated to account for challenges
5. Every challenge + resolution logged in `hypotheses[].challenged` / `hypotheses[].resolution`

## Dependency Graph

```
T1: competitor discovery        (no deps)
T2: pricing extraction          addBlockedBy: [T1]   ← needs competitor URLs
T3: positioning synthesis       addBlockedBy: [T1]   ← needs competitor frame
T4: debate phase                addBlockedBy: [T1, T2, T3]
T5: synthesize + persist        addBlockedBy: [T4]
```

Note: T2 and T3 both depend on T1 (not parallel with it) because pricing and positioning both frame *against* the discovered competitors. Once T1 writes rows to `competitors`, T2 and T3 run in parallel.

## Execution: `product {slug} [--python-focus]`

```
Step 1: Parse slug. Check DB: does the product exist? Any open competitor_analyses row?
Step 2: If no open analysis, call createCompetitorAnalysis(productId) — gets analysisId
Step 3: TeamCreate { name: "product-{slug}" }
Step 4: TaskCreate T1–T5 with the dependency graph above
Step 5: Spawn Competitor Analyst (claims T1) with python_focus flag threaded through
Step 6: When T1 completes (competitors rows written), spawn Pricing + Positioning Analysts in parallel
Step 7: T1+T2+T3 done → activate debate phase (T4)
Step 8: Debate settles or 2min timeout → synthesize (T5, orchestrator-inline): flip competitor_analyses.status='done', write team report to ~/.claude/state/product-{slug}-analysis.json
Step 9: TeamDelete → show UI link /products/{slug}/competitors
```

## Execution: `product batch {slug1} {slug2} ...`

One team per product, all spawned in parallel. After all complete, show comparative summary: which products have the strongest moat, which have the most crowded pricing landscapes, which have the best positioning gaps.

## Product Rules

1. **TeamCreate per product** — never reuse teams
2. **Debate is mandatory** — single-agent shortcut path doesn't exist for products (unlike `/research score`)
3. **Never trigger outreach or deploy** — analysis output feeds the UI, user decides what to ship
4. **Seed from DB** — every agent must check `products`, `competitor_analyses`, `competitors`, `competitor_pricing_tiers` before doing web research
5. **Debate timeout**: 2 minutes of silence → close debate
6. **`--python-focus` applies to ALL 3 agents** — Competitor Analyst biases discovery, Pricing Analyst accepts OSS-only pricing shapes, Positioning Analyst frames against Python-ecosystem alternatives in the moat hypotheses
7. **Never overwrite prior Python-pipeline output** — the `competitors_team` / `deep_competitor` / `pricing` LangGraph graphs may have populated rows; mark Claude-authored writes with `authored_by: "claude-team"` in jsonb fields so the UI can distinguish provenance

              │   deploy)    │
              └──────────────┘
```

| Agent | Skill | Design Philosophy |
|---|---|---|
| **Expert 1** | `logo-expert` | Minimalist — Stripe/Linear clean geometry |
| **Expert 2** | `logo-expert` | Geometric — sacred geometry, mathematical precision |
| **Expert 3** | `logo-expert` | Neural Network — interconnected nodes, AI visualization |
| **Expert 4** | `logo-expert` | Funnel Flow — particle stream through abstract curves |
| **Expert 5** | `logo-expert` | Constellation — star-map with connected dots |

| **Expert 9** | `logo-expert` | Waveform/Signal — noise-to-signal transformation |
| **Expert 10** | `logo-expert` | Origami/Faceted — low-poly triangular facets |

## Design Philosophies Pool

When spawning, cycle through these philosophies. For N > 10, repeat with "remix" variants:

```
minimalist, geometric, neural, funnel, constellation,
orbital, gradient, isometric, waveform, origami,
typographic, brutalist, art-deco, bauhaus, glitch,
vaporwave, botanical, topographic, circuit, crystalline
```

## Execution: `logo [count] [target]`

```
Step 1: Parse count (default 10) and target app (default: current app)
Step 2: Read current logo from public/logo.svg
Step 3: Read brand context from CLAUDE.md (name, purpose, audience)
Step 4: Spawn N agents in PARALLEL, each with:
        - Unique design_philosophy from the pool
        - Same brand context and constraints
        - Output: public/logo-v{N}-{philosophy}.svg
Step 5: Wait for all agents to complete
Step 6: List all generated variants with file sizes
Step 7: Show comparison table: variant | philosophy | file size | key concept
```

## Execution: `logo pick`

```
Step 1: Glob public/logo-v*.svg — list all variants
Step 2: Read each variant SVG
Step 3: Score each on: scalability, concept clarity, color cohesion, SVG cleanliness, file size
Step 4: Show ranked comparison table
Step 5: PAUSE — let user pick the winner
Step 6: Copy winner to public/logo.svg (backup old as public/logo-prev.svg)
Step 7: Copy winner to logo.svg (root)
Step 8: Show "deployed" confirmation
```

## Logo Agent Prompt Template

```
You are Logo Expert #{n} in a parallel design team.
Your design philosophy: {philosophy}

Read and follow: .claude/skills/logo-expert/SKILL.md
Read current logo: {current_logo_path}

Brand: {brand_name}
Context: {brand_context}

Write your logo to: {output_path}

Requirements:
- SVG, viewBox "0 0 300 140", dark background (#050515 to #0c0c25)
- Must convey: {brand_keywords}
- Must scale to 32x32 (favicon/collapsed sidebar)
- No text/wordmark in SVG
- Max 2-3 colors, max 2 filters
- Prefix all IDs with "v{n}-" to avoid conflicts
- Under 5KB file size

Design, write, report your key decisions.
```

## Logo Rules

1. **ALL experts run in PARALLEL** — never sequential
2. **Each expert gets a UNIQUE philosophy** — no duplicates in a batch
3. **User picks the winner** — never auto-deploy a logo
4. **Backup before deploy** — always save previous logo as logo-prev.svg
5. **No text in SVG** — wordmarks are handled by the UI components
