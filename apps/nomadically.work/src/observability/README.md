## Why Langfuse Prompt Management?

### Decouple Prompt Updates from Code Deployment

Instead of hardcoding prompts in your application, Langfuse allows you to:

- **Update prompts instantly** without engineering involvement or deployments
- **Iterate faster** - Product managers and domain experts can refine prompts directly in the UI
- **Version control** - Track every change with automatic versioning
- **A/B test** - Deploy multiple prompt versions and compare performance across environments

**Traditional approach:** Prompt change → Code change → Review → Deploy (hours/days)  
**Langfuse approach:** Update prompt in UI → Auto-deployed (seconds)

### No Latency, No Availability Risk

Langfuse Prompt Management adds **zero latency** to your application:

- Prompts are **cached client-side** by the SDK
- Retrieving prompts is as fast as reading from memory
- Your application continues working even if Langfuse is temporarily unavailable (uses fallbacks)

## Evaluation Workflow

### Testing Remote EU Job Classification

The application uses a comprehensive evaluation workflow for remote EU job classification:

1. **Define Test Cases** - Curated dataset of edge cases ([test-data.ts](../evals/remote-eu/test-data.ts))
2. **Create Prompts** - Manage prompts in Langfuse UI with versioning
3. **Run Evaluations** - Execute `eval-remote-eu-langfuse.ts` script to test classification accuracy
4. **Analyze Results** - Review traces, scores, and failures in Langfuse dashboard
5. **Iterate** - Update prompts based on insights, repeat evaluation

This workflow enables:

- **Regression Testing** - Ensure prompt changes don't break existing scenarios
- **Version Comparison** - A/B test different prompt versions quantitatively
- **Edge Case Coverage** - Validate handling of tricky cases (EMEA vs EU, UK post-Brexit, etc.)
- **Continuous Improvement** - Data-driven prompt refinement

See [Remote EU Classification Evaluation](#remote-eu-classification-evaluation) for usage details.

## Core Concepts

### Prompt Types

- **Text**: Simple string prompts (most common)
- **Chat**: Structured messages with roles (system, user, assistant)

### Versioning

- Every prompt change creates a new version automatically
- Versions are immutable and numbered sequentially
- Fetch latest version or specific version by number

### Labels

- Tag versions with labels like `production`, `staging`, `experimental`
- Control which version is used in different environments
- Multiple labels supported per version

### Configuration

- Store model parameters, temperature, tokens alongside prompts
- Keep all LLM config in one place for easy experimentation

## Getting Started

### 1. Create Prompts in Langfuse UI

1. **Login to Langfuse**  
   Go to https://cloud.langfuse.com

2. **Navigate to Prompts**  
   Click "Prompts" in sidebar → "New Prompt"

3. **Create the Prompt**
   - **Name**: `job-classifier` (must match code)
   - **Type**: Text
   - **Prompt Content**:

     ```
     You are an expert at classifying job postings for Remote EU positions.

     CRITICAL RULES:
     1. Only classify as "Remote EU" (isRemoteEU: true) if the job EXPLICITLY mentions EU, European Union, or lists only EU member countries.
     2. Use HIGH confidence only when explicitly clear; MEDIUM for likely scenarios; LOW for ambiguous cases.

     IMPORTANT DISTINCTIONS:
     - "EMEA" (Europe, Middle East, Africa) is NOT EU - includes non-EU countries like UK (post-Brexit), Switzerland, Middle East, Africa. Mark as isRemoteEU: false unless explicitly restricted to EU member states.
     - "Europe" alone is TOO BROAD - includes non-EU countries (UK, Switzerland, Norway, etc.). Mark as isRemoteEU: false with LOW confidence unless context clarifies.
     - "CET timezone" is NOT exclusive to EU - includes Switzerland and some African countries. Mark as isRemoteEU: false with MEDIUM confidence.
     - "UK only" is NOT EU since Brexit. Mark as isRemoteEU: false with HIGH confidence.
     - "Switzerland only" is NOT EU (not a member state). Mark as isRemoteEU: false with HIGH confidence.
     - "EEA" (European Economic Area) includes all EU + Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein. Mark as isRemoteEU: true with MEDIUM confidence (mostly EU).
     - "Schengen Area" mostly overlaps with EU but includes some non-EU (Switzerland, Norway). Mark as isRemoteEU: true with MEDIUM confidence.

     POSITIVE INDICATORS (isRemoteEU: true):
     - Explicitly states "Remote - EU", "European Union", "EU countries"
     - Lists only EU member countries (Germany, France, Spain, Italy, etc.)
     - Requires "EU work authorization", "EU passport", "right to work in EU"
     - States "EU member states only"
     - EMEA or Europe BUT explicitly restricted to "EU countries only" or "EU member states"

     NEGATIVE INDICATORS (isRemoteEU: false):
     - EMEA without EU restriction
     - Europe without EU restriction
     - UK only (post-Brexit)
     - Switzerland only
     - CET timezone without EU mention
     - Includes non-EU countries (UK, Switzerland, Norway, etc.) in list

     Provide your classification with a clear reasoning based on the job title, location, and description.
     ```

   - Click "Create"

4. **Set Labels (Optional)**
   - Tag version as `production` to mark it as the production-ready version
   - Use labels like `staging`, `experimental` for different environments
   - The SDK can fetch by label: `langfuse.getPrompt("job-classifier", { label: "production" })`
5. How It Works

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Agent Starts] --> B{Fetch from Cache?}
    B -->|Cache Hit| C[Use Cached Prompt]
    B -->|Cache Miss| D[Fetch from Langfuse]
    D --> E{Success?}
    E -->|Yes| F[Cache + Use Prompt]
    E -->|No| G[Use Fallback]
    C --> H[Link to Trace]
    F --> H
    G --> H
```

**On Agent Initialization:**

1. Agent calls `getPrompt(PROMPTS.JOB_CLASSIFIER)`
2. Check in-memory cache first (instant)
3. If not cached, fetch from Langfuse API
4. Cache the result for subsequent calls
5. If fetch fails, use hardcoded fallback
6. Return prompt text + tracing options

**During Generation:**

- All LLM calls are automatically linked to the prompt version used
- Langfuse dashboard shows which prompt version generated which output
- Enables prompt performance analysis and A/B testing

### 3. Performance & Analytics

**Automatic Metrics by Prompt Version:**

- ✅ Token usage
- ✅Code Integration
- ✅ Cost tracking
- ✅ Quality scores (relevancy, toxicity, bias, hallucination)
- ✅ User feedback and annotations

**Prompt Performance Analysis:**

```typescript
// In Langfuse dashboard, compare:
// - Prompt v1 vs v2 token efficiency
// - Which version has better relevancy scores
// - Cost differences between versions
// - User feedback by prompt version
```

### 4. Advanced Usage

#### Fetch Specific Versions

```typescript
// Fetch version 2 explicitly
const { text, tracingOptions } = await getPrompt({
  name: "job-classifier",
  version: 2,
  fallbackText: "...",
});
```

#### A/B Testing Prompts

```typescript
// Deploy two agents with different prompt versions
const agentA = createAgent(await getPrompt({ name: "prompt-v1", ... }));
const agentB = createAgent(await getPrompt({ name: "prompt-v2", ... }));

// Route 50% traffic to each, compare metrics in Langfuse
```

#### Environment-based Labels

```typescript
// In production
const prompt = await langfuse.getPrompt("job-classifier", {
  label: "production",
});

// In staging
const prompt = await langfuse.getPrompt("job-classifier", {
  label: "staging",
});
```

const prompt = await langfuse.getPrompt("job-classifier", 2); // version 2

````

#### A/B Testing

Deploy multiple agents with different prompt versions and compare metrics in Langfuse dashboard.

## Using Prompt Management

### Basic Usage

```typescript
import { getPrompt, PROMPTS } from "@/observability";

// Fetch a predefined prompt
**Client-side caching** ensures zero-latency prompt retrieval:

```typescript
import { clearPromptCache } from "@/observability";

// Clear all cached prompts (forces refetch from Langfuse on next request)
clearPromptCache();

// Useful when:
// - Testing prompt updates locally
// - Forcing immediate prompt refresh
// - Debugging prompt issues
````

**Cache behavior:**

- Prompts are cached in-memory by `(name, version)` key
- Cache persists for application lifetime
- No external & Analysis

### Langfuse Dashboard

Access at https://cloud.langfuse.com

**Traces**

- View all agent and workflow executions
- See input/output, latency, token usage, cost
- Filter by prompt version, environment, user
- Debug failures and unexpected outputs

**Prompts**

- Navigate to **Prompts → job-classifier**
- View all versions and their deployment history
- See usage analytics per version:
  - Total generations
  - Average tokens
  - Cost
  - Quality scores
- Compare versions side-by-side

**Scores**

- Agent scorers automatically tracked:
  - Answer Relevancy (25% sampling)
  - Toxicity (100% sampling)
  - Bias (25% sampling)
  - Hallucination (25% sampling)
- View score trends over time
- Filter by prompt version to see quality impact

**Sessions**

- Group related traces by session ID
- Track multi-turn conversations
- Analyze user journeys

### Best Practices

1. **Version Control**: Always test new prompts in staging before production
2. **Labels**: Use `production`, `staging`, `dev` labels to manage deployments
3. **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for quality score degradation
4. **Iteration**: Use Langfuse metrics to guide prompt improvements
5. **Fallbacks**: Always provide meaningful fallback text for offline scenarios
6. **Documentation**: Document prompt intent and expected behavior in Langfuse

### Troubleshooting

**Prompt not updating in app?**

- Check if prompt is labeled `production` (if fetching by label)
- Clear prompt cache: `clearPromptCache()`
- Verify environment variables are set

**Langfuse unavailable?**

- Application continues with fallback prompts
- Check logs for fetch errors
- Verify LANGFUSE_BASE_URL is correct

**Tracing not linked to prompts?**

- Ensure `tracingOptions` is passed to agent's `defaultGenerateOptions`
- Verify prompt was fetched successfully (check for fallback warnings)

## Remote EU Classification Evaluation

### Running Evaluations with Langfuse

Use the evaluation script to test the latest prompt against all remote EU test cases using DeepSeek:

```bash
# Run full evaluation with latest prompt
pnpm tsx scripts/eval-remote-eu-langfuse.ts
```

The script will:

- ✅ Fetch the latest prompt from Langfuse
- ✅ Run classification on all 12 test cases
- ✅ Send full traces to Langfuse with scores
- ✅ Generate accuracy report
- ✅ Link all traces in a single session for analysis

**View results:**

- Session link printed at end of run
- Navigate to Langfuse → Sessions to see grouped traces
- View individual traces with full context
- Analyze failures with expected vs actual classifications

**Output includes:**

- Per-case results with scores
- Overall accuracy percentage
- Confidence match rate
- Detailed failure analysis
- Direct link to Langfuse session

### Comparing Prompt Versions

To compare different prompt versions:

1. Run evaluation with current prompt (creates baseline)
2. Update prompt in Langfuse UI (creates new version)
3. Run evaluation again with new version
4. Compare sessions in Langfuse dashboard to see accuracy changes

const { text, tracingOptions } = await getPrompt({
  name: "my-custom-prompt",
  fallbackText: "Fallback instructions if Langfuse is unavailable",
});
```

### Specific Versions

```typescript
const { text, tracingOptions } = await getPrompt({
  name: "job-classifier",
  version: 2, // Fetch version 2 specifically
  fallbackText: "...",
});
```

### Adding New Prompts

1. Add to `PROMPTS` constant in `prompts.ts`:

```typescript
export const PROMPTS = {
  JOB_CLASSIFIER: {
    name: "job-classifier",
    fallbackText: "...",
  },
  MY_NEW_PROMPT: {
    name: "my-new-prompt",
    fallbackText: "...",
  },
} as const;
```

2. Create the prompt in Langfuse dashboard with the same name

### Cache Management

```typescript
import { clearPromptCache } from "@/observability";

// Clear all cached prompts (forces refetch from Langfuse)
clearPromptCache();
```

## Environment Variables

Ensure these are set in `.env`:

```env
LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY="***REMOVED***"
LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY="***REMOVED***"
LANGFUSE_BASE_URL="https://cloud.langfuse.com"
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY="your-deepseek-api-key"
```
